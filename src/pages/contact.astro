      Use this email for calculator feedback, data corrections, or new tool requests. If you are asking about pricing
      models, include your unit definition (calls, events, GB, seats), expected monthly volume, and any major cost drivers
      (infra, vendors, support). That context helps us point you to the right calculator or guide and update assumptions
      when needed. We also welcome notes about confusing terminology, missing use cases, or examples you want to see in the
      guides.
    </p>
    <p class="muted" style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
      Typical response time is 1-2 business days. Please avoid sharing confidential data; summary inputs are enough for us
      to validate formulas and improve the toolkit.
