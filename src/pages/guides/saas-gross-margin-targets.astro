    <h1>SaaS gross margin targets</h1>
    <p>
      Gross margin targets are not universal. The safest approach is to pick a defensible range, model uncertainty, and
      revisit as costs and customer segments change.

      <h2>What “gross margin” should include</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        For most SaaS teams, gross margin starts with revenue minus the direct costs required to deliver the service:
        cloud infrastructure, third‑party vendors tied to usage, customer support that scales with volume, and payment
        processing where applicable. If you only include infra, you may overstate margin.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 1.25rem;">How to choose a target range</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Start with a baseline range (for many SaaS categories, 70–90% is common).</li>
        <li>Adjust down if your product has heavy variable costs (LLM/API pass‑through, bandwidth, storage).</li>
        <li>Adjust up only if you can reliably keep variable costs low at scale.</li>
        <li>Model per‑segment margins; enterprise and self‑serve can have different cost structures.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 1.25rem;">The common failure mode</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        The most common pricing mistake is treating variable costs as “someone else’s problem.” If your unit costs rise
        with customer usage, you need either (a) usage‑based pricing, (b) minimums and overages, or (c) strict limits.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 1.25rem;">How to model uncertainty (recommended)</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Use scenarios (best/base/worst) for cost per unit and monthly volume (p50 vs p90 usage).</li>
        <li>Use blended unit costs (weighted averages) if you have multiple regions/instance types.</li>
        <li>Recalculate after discounts (commitments, reserved instances, volume tiers).</li>
      </ul>
