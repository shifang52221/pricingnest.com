## Quick checklist
- Define the activation milestone clearly.
- Match trial limits to time-to-value.
- Ensure the first paid tier is easy to adopt.
- Avoid surprise usage bills during trial.
- Track trial-to-paid conversion weekly.

## Step-by-step
1. Identify your activation event and timing.
2. Set trial limits that enable activation.
3. Price the entry tier for low-friction upgrade.
4. Model MRR impact of conversion changes.
5. Adjust trial rules based on cohort data.

## What to watch
- Long trials can hide churn risk.
- Too-low entry pricing reduces ARPA.
- Misaligned trials lead to low activation.

## Common mistakes
- Using the same trial limits for all segments.
- Forcing upgrades before value is reached.
- Ignoring product-led expansion after trial.
