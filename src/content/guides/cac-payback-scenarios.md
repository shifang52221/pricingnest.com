## Quick checklist
- Use base, optimistic, and conservative assumptions.
- Keep churn consistent with retention reporting.
- Include onboarding or support costs in margin.
- Set a hard ceiling for CAC by channel.
- Re-check after pricing changes.

## Step-by-step
1. Calculate base payback with current ARPA and margin.
2. Increase churn to model a downside scenario.
3. Raise ARPA to test expansion upside.
4. Convert payback limits into max CAC.
5. Use the break-even CAC as the hard cap.

## Signals to act on
- Payback above target means you must raise ARPA or cut CAC.
- Short payback allows more aggressive channel spend.
- Wide sensitivity range means weak pricing confidence.

## Common mistakes
- Using blended CAC instead of channel-level CAC.
- Ignoring implementation or onboarding costs.
- Treating discounting as permanent ARPA.
