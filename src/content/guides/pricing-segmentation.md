## Quick checklist
- Define 2-3 primary segments (SMB, mid-market, enterprise).
- Keep one core value metric across segments.
- Use tier limits to separate segments.
- Model ARPA targets per segment.
- Avoid custom pricing for every deal.

## Step-by-step
1. Map segments to their usage ranges.
2. Define tier limits and upgrade triggers.
3. Set price bands by segment ARPA.
4. Add enterprise minimums if needed.
5. Track conversion and churn by segment.

## What to watch
- Too many segments create pricing chaos.
- Misaligned tiers drive downgrade pressure.
- Weak Pro tier reduces expansion.

## Common mistakes
- Mixing segment labels with tier labels.
- Overusing discounts instead of segmentation.
- Ignoring support cost differences.
