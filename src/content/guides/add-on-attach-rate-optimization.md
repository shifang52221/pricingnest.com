## Quick checklist
- Limit add-ons to 3 to 5 high-value items.
- Place add-ons after plan selection.
- Tie add-ons to clear outcomes.
- Monitor attach rates by segment.
- Review add-on margin quarterly.

## Step-by-step
1. Identify add-ons with strong usage or support cost drivers.
2. Price add-ons with a clear unit definition.
3. Position add-ons as an upgrade path in the UI.
4. Track attach rate by plan and channel.
5. Adjust pricing based on NRR impact.

## What to watch
- Add-ons that confuse plan selection.
- Too many add-ons that feel like hidden fees.
- Add-ons with weak margin contribution.

## Common mistakes
- Bundling all add-ons into the top plan.
- Selling add-ons without usage visibility.
- Failing to update add-on copy after changes.
