## Quick checklist
- Estimate support hours by tier.
- Convert hours to per-account cost.
- Include support costs in COGS.
- Adjust tier pricing to hit margins.
- Review support costs quarterly.

## Step-by-step
1. Measure support time by plan.
2. Convert time to cost per account.
3. Add support cost to unit cost model.
4. Recalculate tier prices.
5. Track margin impact by tier.

## What to watch
- High-touch tiers often hide support costs.
- Support costs rise after pricing changes.
- Unpriced support erodes margins.

## Common mistakes
- Using blended support costs for all tiers.
- Ignoring onboarding labor.
- Treating support as fixed cost only.
