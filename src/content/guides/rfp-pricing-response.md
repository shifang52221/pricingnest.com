## Quick checklist
- Include a simple rate card.
- State assumptions and exclusions clearly.
- Provide a usage example with totals.
- Align pricing with your public page.
- Keep terms consistent with legal.

## Step-by-step
1. Build a rate card with your primary unit.
2. Add a sample monthly and annual estimate.
3. Document assumptions for volume and usage.
4. Confirm discount policy and approvals.
5. Review with finance and legal before sending.

## What to watch
- RFPs that ask for hidden discounts.
- Pricing that conflicts with public tiers.
- Terms that create implementation scope creep.

## Common mistakes
- Sending a rate card without context.
- Using legacy pricing in new RFPs.
- Skipping approval for custom discounts.
