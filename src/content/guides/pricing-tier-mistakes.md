## Quick checklist
- Keep the tier ladder clear (Basic, Pro, Enterprise).
- Use one primary value metric per tier.
- Ensure the Pro tier is the default target.
- Avoid overlapping limits that create confusion.
- Validate pricing against target ARPA.

## Mistake patterns
- **Too many tiers**: decision paralysis and low conversion.
- **Weak Pro tier**: upgrades stall and ARPA drops.
- **Overlapping limits**: customers stay in cheaper tiers.
- **Enterprise underpriced**: high-touch costs eat margin.
- **Mixed value metrics**: pricing feels arbitrary.

## Fixes that work
- Anchor pricing with a clear Basic tier.
- Use Pro as the most compelling value tier.
- Increase Enterprise multiplier for high-touch plans.
- Remove overlapping limits and clarify upgrade paths.
- Recalculate prices using your plan mix.
