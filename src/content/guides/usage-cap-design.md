## Quick checklist
- Cap usage for the highest-risk tiers.
- Trigger alerts before caps hit.
- Offer upgrade paths at cap limits.
- Align caps with tier breakpoints.
- Re-check after usage growth.

## Step-by-step
1. Identify the usage band with margin risk.
2. Set a cap above the upgrade threshold.
3. Model overage revenue vs churn risk.
4. Add alerts and in-app upgrade prompts.
5. Review cap performance quarterly.

## What to watch
- Caps that are too low block expansion.
- Unclear caps cause trust issues.
- Overages without caps can trigger churn.

## Common mistakes
- Using caps as a substitute for clear tiers.
- Hiding caps in terms of service.
- Ignoring high-usage enterprise exceptions.
