## Quick checklist
- Separate expansion from new logo revenue.
- Track expansion rate by plan and segment.
- Compare expansion lift to churn impact.
- Use monthly cohorts for consistency.
- Reconcile with finance definitions.

## Step-by-step
1. Export starting MRR by cohort and plan.
2. Measure expansion MRR from upgrades and add-ons.
3. Compute GRR and NRR for the same cohort window.
4. Compare expansion lift to churn and downgrades.
5. Set an expansion target that stabilizes NRR.

## What good looks like
- Expansion is repeatable and tied to product adoption.
- Upsells are triggered by clear usage or value thresholds.
- Expansion does not mask rising churn in core plans.

## Common mistakes
- Counting new customer revenue as expansion.
- Ignoring downgrades within expansion totals.
- Mixing annual and monthly timeframes.
