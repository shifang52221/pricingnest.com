## Quick checklist
- Keep 5-7 feature rows per tier.
- Highlight the primary value metric clearly.
- Make the Pro tier the default choice.
- Avoid overlapping limits between tiers.
- Test the table on mobile screens.

## Step-by-step
1. List the top 5 value drivers for upgrades.
2. Map each driver to a tier with clean limits.
3. Add a single primary value metric row.
4. Validate pricing deltas with the tier optimizer.
5. Review the table with sales and support.

## Table signals
- If customers ask for clarification, limits are unclear.
- If upgrades stall, Pro is under-differentiated.
- If Enterprise is too cheap, services are underpriced.

## Common mistakes
- Overloading the table with small feature differences.
- Hiding the primary value metric below the fold.
- Using inconsistent naming between tiers.
