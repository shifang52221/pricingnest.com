## Quick checklist
- Localize currency and payment methods.
- Keep tier structure consistent globally.
- Use region-specific price bands.
- Model FX impact on ARPA.
- Review localization quarterly.

## Step-by-step
1. Choose target regions and currencies.
2. Set regional price bands around ARPA targets.
3. Align billing cycles with local norms.
4. Test conversion and churn by region.
5. Update pricing after FX shifts.

## What to watch
- Inconsistent tiers create support overhead.
- FX volatility can break margin targets.
- Local payment friction reduces conversion.

## Common mistakes
- Over-localizing plan names and limits.
- Ignoring tax and invoice requirements.
- Using one global discount rate.
