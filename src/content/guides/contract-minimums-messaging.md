## Quick checklist
- State the minimum commitment in plain language.
- Show how usage draws down the minimum.
- Provide a simple example invoice.
- Keep rate card links easy to find.
- Align sales quotes and page copy.

## Step-by-step
1. Write a one-line definition of the minimum.
2. Add an example that shows drawdown.
3. Link to the rate card for unit pricing.
4. Explain what happens when usage is below minimum.
5. Validate wording with sales and legal.

## What to watch
