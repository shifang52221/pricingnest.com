## Quick checklist
- Pick 4 to 6 signals max.
- Weight signals by historical churn impact.
- Refresh scores weekly or monthly.
- Alert account owners on high risk.
- Track score accuracy over time.

## Step-by-step
1. Choose signals like usage drop, ticket volume, and renewal date.
2. Assign weights based on past churn events.
3. Create low, medium, and high risk bands.
4. Review the list with success and sales teams.
5. Update weights quarterly.

## What to watch
- Scores that never change.
- Using too many signals to explain.
- Missing renewal timing in the score.

## Common mistakes

- Not validating against real churn history.
- Ignoring product usage trends.
