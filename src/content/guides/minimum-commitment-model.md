## Quick checklist
- Tie commitments to measurable value delivery.
- Separate platform fees from minimum usage.
- Align commitments with contract length.
- Validate impact on conversion rates.
- Review annually as usage grows.

## Step-by-step
1. Estimate fixed costs per account.
2. Set a minimum that covers fixed costs.
3. Model the effect on plan mix and ARPA.
4. Translate commitments into TCV ranges.
5. Test with sales and customer success.

## What to watch
- Commitments that are too high reduce close rates.
- Low commitments increase margin risk.
- Inconsistent commitments cause negotiation churn.

## Common mistakes
- Mixing commitments with overage pricing.
- Forgetting annual vs monthly terms.
- Ignoring procurement limits for mid-market.
