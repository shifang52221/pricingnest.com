## Quick checklist
- Measure both revenue and logo churn monthly.
- Segment churn by plan and customer size.
- Watch for high logo churn masked by expansion.
- Align churn definitions with finance reporting.
- Track downgrade volume separately from churn.

## Step-by-step
1. Count logos churned in the period.
2. Sum lost MRR from churned logos.
3. Calculate revenue churn rate and logo churn rate.
4. Compare rates by segment and plan.
5. Use the gap to prioritize retention work.

## How to interpret the gap
- High logo churn, low revenue churn: churn is concentrated in small plans.
- Low logo churn, high revenue churn: large accounts are at risk.
- Both high: retention and onboarding are broken.

## Common mistakes
- Using annual churn to explain monthly retention changes.
- Combining downgrades with logo churn.
- Ignoring contraction inside active accounts.
