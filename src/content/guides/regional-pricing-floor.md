## Quick checklist
- Set a margin-based floor per region.
- Use the same value metric across regions.
- Keep currency rounding simple.
- Align floors with local purchasing power.
- Review floors after cost changes.

## Step-by-step
1. Calculate unit costs by region.
2. Apply your target gross margin range.
3. Convert to local currency with a buffer.
4. Round to buyer-friendly price points.
5. Validate with a small set of customers.

## What to watch
- Floors that are below unit cost.
- Too many regional price points.
- Inconsistent value metric definitions.

## Common mistakes
- Using FX rates without margin buffers.
