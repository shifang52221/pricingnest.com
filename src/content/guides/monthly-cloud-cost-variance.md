## Quick checklist
- Track variance drivers by service and region.
- Separate fixed baseline from usage spikes.
- Normalize costs per unit of usage.
- Review commitments and reserved instances.
- Use variance to refine pricing assumptions.

## Step-by-step
1. Compare monthly cloud invoices to the baseline.
2. Attribute variance to compute, storage, or bandwidth.
3. Calculate unit cost deltas per usage unit.
4. Update pricing floors or platform fees.
5. Monitor impact on gross margin targets.

## Variance signals
- Sharp spikes usually come from usage outliers.
- Gradual creep indicates product usage growth.
- Unexplained variance may signal logging gaps.

## Common mistakes
- Mixing variable usage with fixed overhead.
- Ignoring currency or regional pricing shifts.
- Delaying pricing updates after cost changes.
