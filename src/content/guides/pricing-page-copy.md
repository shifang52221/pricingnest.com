## Quick checklist
- Lead with the primary value metric.
- Keep tier names consistent across pages.
- Use short, concrete benefit statements.
- Explain included usage and overages.
- Add one comparison table.

## Step-by-step
1. Define the core value statement by tier.
2. Align labels with the value metric.
3. Add a single line for limits and overages.
4. Include a short use case per tier.
5. Test copy for clarity with sales.

## What to watch
- Copy that only lists features reduces upgrades.

- Mixed units create billing confusion.

## Common mistakes
