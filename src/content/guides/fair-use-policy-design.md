## Quick checklist
- Define fair use in plain language.
- Tie fair use to published tier limits.
- Add usage alerts before enforcement.
- Document exceptions clearly.
- Review enforcement quarterly.

## Step-by-step
1. Define the usage behavior considered abusive.
2. Align fair use with tier limits.
3. Add alerts and upgrade paths.
4. Document enforcement process.
5. Track churn after enforcement.

## What to watch

- Over-enforcement causes churn.
- Missing alerts create billing disputes.

## Common mistakes
- Using fair use instead of clear pricing.
- Hiding fair use in terms only.
- Ignoring enterprise contract terms.
