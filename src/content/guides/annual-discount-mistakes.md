## Quick checklist
- Compare effective monthly rates, not just discount percent.
- Segment discounts by customer size or sales motion.
- Model cash flow benefits vs margin impact.
- Make discount policies consistent across sales and self-serve.
- Validate renewal churn assumptions before committing.

## Common mistakes
- Offering a flat 20-30% discount without checking margin impact.
- Using the same discount across SMB and enterprise segments.
- Ignoring that annual buyers churn less (or more) than monthly buyers.
- Hiding effective monthly rate, which confuses buyers.

## Step-by-step
1. Calculate the effective monthly rate after discount.
2. Estimate the cash flow benefit vs the revenue discount.
3. Compare churn for annual vs monthly customers.
4. Decide whether to offer a single discount or tiered discounts.
5. Validate results with the annual discount calculator.

## Example scenarios
- **SMB self-serve**: 15% discount to improve cash flow and reduce churn.
- **Mid-market**: 10% discount tied to minimum spend.
- **Enterprise**: smaller discount with multi-year commitment.
