## Quick checklist
- Define free tier limits by calls and time window.
- Use rate limits to control abuse.
- Track free tier conversion to paid tiers.
- Price overages transparently.
- Review cost impact monthly.

## Step-by-step
1. Estimate cost per 1,000 calls.
2. Choose a free tier call limit aligned with activation.
3. Add rate limits or throttling for protection.
4. Model paid tiers with overage pricing.
5. Monitor abuse and adjust limits.

## Guardrails that work
- Short evaluation windows that nudge upgrades.
- Alerts when teams approach limits.
- Clear usage dashboards in the product.

## Common mistakes
- Setting free limits without cost data.
- Relying on fair-use language alone.
- Hiding overage pricing behind sales.
