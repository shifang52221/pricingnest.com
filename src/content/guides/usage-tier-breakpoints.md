## Quick checklist
- Anchor tiers to customer value milestones.
- Keep tier steps simple and predictable.
- Align included usage with onboarding success.
- Model upgrade paths for your Pro tier.
- Test breakpoints against revenue targets.

## Step-by-step
1. Identify usage bands for your key segments.
2. Choose included usage for each tier.
3. Price overages above the included threshold.
4. Run the tiered usage calculator to validate.
5. Stress-test against high-usage outliers.

## Breakpoint signals
- Upgrade rates stall when tiers overlap.
- Large jumps create bill shock and churn.
- Small jumps fail to move ARPA.

## Common mistakes
- Setting breakpoints based on internal cost only.
- Ignoring the onboarding time-to-value window.
- Using too many micro tiers.
