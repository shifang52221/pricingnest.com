## Quick checklist
- Segment usage patterns by plan and size.
- Model p50 and p90 usage mixes.
- Align included usage with activation goals.
- Use tiers to manage heavy users.
- Update the mix quarterly.

## Step-by-step
1. Pull usage distribution by segment.
2. Define a usage mix for each tier.
3. Estimate revenue at each mix point.
4. Stress-test margin with high-usage outliers.
5. Adjust tiers or caps to stabilize margins.

## What to watch
- High-variance usage needs clearer tiers.
- Underpriced overages lead to churn risk.
- Hidden usage drivers break forecasts.

## Common mistakes
- Using a single average for all segments.
- Ignoring seasonal usage spikes.
- Mixing trial usage with paid usage.
