## Quick checklist
- Measure ARPA by plan and segment.
- Separate price increases from expansion.
- Track downgrade pressure after changes.
- Validate ARPA against payback targets.
- Re-test after packaging updates.

## Step-by-step
1. Baseline ARPA by cohort and plan.
2. Model a price increase and expected churn lift.
3. Estimate expansion impact from upsells.
4. Convert ARPA gains into LTV lift.
5. Compare ARPA targets to payback constraints.

## Levers that matter
- Price increases on core tiers.
- Expansion via usage or add-ons.
- Plan mix shift toward Pro.
- Enterprise minimums and platform fees.

## Common mistakes
- Ignoring churn impact of a price increase.
- Mixing ARPA and ARPU in the same model.
- Treating temporary discounts as permanent ARPA.
