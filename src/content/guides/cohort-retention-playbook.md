## Quick checklist
- Define the cohort entry event (signup, activation, paid conversion).
- Track retention monthly for at least 6 months.
- Compare cohorts by plan, channel, and onboarding flow.
- Set a month-1 retention target and monitor weekly.
- Turn retention gains into revenue forecasts.

## Step-by-step
1. Define your cohort and retention event.
2. Input a monthly retention rate to model the curve.
3. Compare month 1 and month 6 retention.
4. Map the biggest drop-off to a product or onboarding fix.
5. Re-run the model with a higher retention rate to quantify upside.

## Common mistakes
- Mixing user retention and revenue retention.
- Using annual retention as a monthly input.
- Ignoring early churn in the first 30 days.
- Averaging cohorts with different product tiers.

## Practical targets
- Month 1 retention is a leading indicator of product-market fit.
- A 1-2 point increase in monthly retention compounds quickly.
- Use retention improvements to inform pricing and packaging moves.
