## Quick checklist
- Define the unit and usage limits clearly on the pricing page.
- Publish example bills for light, typical, and heavy usage.
- Use alerts before customers cross usage thresholds.
- Offer caps or predictable commitments for heavy users.
- Review support tickets for billing confusion patterns.

## Step-by-step
1. Estimate your blended unit costs (infra + vendor pass-through).
2. Add fixed overhead you need to recover.
3. Pick a target gross margin range.
4. Choose tiers and included usage based on typical and heavy customers.
5. Add alerts, caps, or minimums to limit bill volatility.
6. Validate outputs with CSV exports and shareable links.

## Example scenarios
- **Low usage**: included usage covers the first value milestone to avoid early bill shock.
- **Spiky usage**: alert at 80% of included units and cap monthly spend.
- **Enterprise usage**: negotiate a committed spend with discounted overages.

## Common mistakes
- Hiding usage limits in docs instead of on the pricing page.
- Using unclear units (events, credits) without definitions.
- Surprising customers with overages without alerts.
