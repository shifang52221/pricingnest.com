## Quick checklist
- Show usage vs included usage.
- Include a simple forecast for month-end.
- Flag approaching caps early.
- Make export available for finance teams.
- Keep the dashboard load time fast.

## Step-by-step
1. Define the primary usage unit and display it consistently.
2. Add a month-to-date usage graph with a forecast line.
3. Show the next tier breakpoint or cap threshold.
4. Add alerts at 80% and 100% usage.
5. Review dashboard accuracy with billing data.

## What to watch
- Mismatch between dashboard and invoice data.
- Forecasts that swing too much daily.
- Hiding usage behind admin-only roles.

## Common mistakes
- Using different units across pages.
- Omitting overage pricing from the view.
- Not showing a clear upgrade path.
