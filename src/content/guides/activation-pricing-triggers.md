## Quick checklist
- Define the activation event clearly.
- Link the event to an upgrade or expansion prompt.
- Keep prompts in the product, not just email.
- Show the value metric at activation.
- Test prompts with a small cohort first.

## Step-by-step
1. Identify the activation event tied to product value.
2. Map the event to a pricing or usage threshold.
3. Write a short in-product prompt for the event.
4. Measure conversion and churn impact.
5. Iterate monthly on copy and timing.

## What to watch
- Prompts that appear before value is realized.
- Overuse of paywalls that reduce activation.
- Confusing value metrics at the moment of upgrade.

## Common mistakes
- Triggering upgrades on vanity actions.
- Forcing upgrades without clear benefits.
- Using long prompts that break flow.
