## Quick checklist
- Bundle features that share costs and value.
- Keep add-ons for high variance usage.
- Avoid bundles that require heavy support.
- Make upsell paths visible.
- Keep bundle names aligned to outcomes.

## Step-by-step
1. Group features by cost driver and buyer value.
2. Identify which features scale with usage.
3. Convert volatile features into add-ons.
4. Add clear upgrade triggers in the UI.
5. Stress-test bundles with margin targets.

## What to watch
- Bundling high-cost features into low tiers.
- Add-ons that are required for core value.
- Bundles that are too complex to explain.

## Common mistakes
- Using bundles to hide pricing complexity.
- Ignoring support cost variance per plan.
- Changing bundles without migration guidance.
