## Quick checklist
- One primary CTA per plan card.
- Secondary CTA is lower contrast and below the primary.
- Keep CTA labels consistent across plans.
- Use the same CTA placement for all tiers.
- Match CTA text to the buying motion.

## Step-by-step
1. Decide the default buyer path (self-serve vs sales-led).
2. Pick one primary CTA that matches that path.
3. Add a single secondary CTA for the other path.
4. Align CTA copy with plan names and value metric.
5. Run a simple A/B test on CTA text only.

## What to watch
- Two primary CTAs can reduce clicks on both.
- CTA labels that change per plan add friction.
- Hidden or delayed CTAs lower trust.

## Common mistakes
- Mixing "Start trial" and "Contact sales" without context.
- Placing the CTA under long feature lists.
- Using vague CTA copy like "Get started" everywhere.
