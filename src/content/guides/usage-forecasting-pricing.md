## Quick checklist
- Forecast usage by cohort and segment.
- Build a base, upside, and downside scenario.
- Convert usage into cost and revenue ranges.
- Align included usage with activation goals.
- Update forecasts quarterly.

## Step-by-step
1. Pull historical usage distribution by segment.
2. Define expected growth in usage per account.
3. Translate usage into per-unit costs.
4. Model pricing tiers with included usage.
5. Validate margin with the usage calculator.

## Forecasting signals
- Wide usage variance needs clearer tiering.
- Outliers should be managed with caps or enterprise plans.
- Under-forecasting leads to negative margins.

## Common mistakes
- Using a single average for all segments.
- Ignoring seasonal usage spikes.
- Mixing trial usage with paid usage.
