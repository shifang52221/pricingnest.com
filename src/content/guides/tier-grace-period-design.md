## Quick checklist
- Define grace periods by tier.
- Keep terms consistent across billing and support.
- Communicate grace periods before enforcement.
- Track churn impact after changes.
- Prevent repeated abuse with clear limits.

## Step-by-step
1. Choose grace period lengths per tier.
2. Align grace periods with billing cycle cadence.
3. Define what happens after the grace window.
4. Update contracts and help docs.
5. Review churn outcomes each quarter.

## What to watch
- Grace periods that override contract terms.
- Conflicting messaging between teams.
- Lack of enforcement after the grace window.

## Common mistakes
- Giving the same grace period for all tiers.
- Making the policy hard to find.
- Changing the grace policy without notice.
