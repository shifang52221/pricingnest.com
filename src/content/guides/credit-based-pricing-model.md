## Quick checklist
- One credit maps to a clear unit of value.
- Credits map to a predictable unit cost.
- Tiering reduces bill shock for heavy users.
- Expiration rules are simple and explicit.
- Buyers can estimate credits from usage.

## Step-by-step
1. Define what one credit represents in product terms.
2. Calculate unit cost per credit at p50 and p90.
3. Add tiers or bundles that smooth usage spikes.
4. Draft credit expiration and rollover rules.
5. Validate billing and tracking accuracy.

## What to watch
- Credits that hide real unit costs.
- Confusing mappings between credits and usage.
- Expiration rules that feel punitive.

## Common mistakes
- Pricing credits without cost validation.
- Letting credits cover unrelated features.
- Mixing credits with another pricing metric.
