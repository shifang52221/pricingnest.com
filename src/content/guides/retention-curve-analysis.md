## Quick checklist
- Define your cohort start event clearly.
- Track retention monthly for at least 6 months.
- Compare curves before and after product changes.
- Focus on month-1 and month-3 retention as early signals.
- Translate retention gains into LTV impact.

## Step-by-step
1. Plot the retention curve for a recent cohort.
2. Identify the steepest drop-off month.
3. Map the drop-off to onboarding or product friction.
4. Model a 1-2 point retention improvement.
5. Quantify the revenue upside using LTV.

## What to optimize first
- Onboarding flow and time-to-value
- Core feature adoption and activation
- Pricing clarity and value messaging
- Support response time during onboarding

## Common mistakes
- Comparing cohorts with different acquisition channels.
- Using annual retention rates for monthly curves.
- Ignoring seasonality in trial start dates.
- Treating revenue retention as user retention.
