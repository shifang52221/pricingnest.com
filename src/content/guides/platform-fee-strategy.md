## Quick checklist
- Use platform fees to cover fixed costs.
- Keep the fee tied to a clear value promise.
- Combine platform fees with usage overages.
- Offer annual commitments for enterprise tiers.
- Re-check fees after cost structure changes.

## Step-by-step
1. Estimate fixed costs per account or segment.
2. Choose a platform fee that covers those costs.
3. Set usage pricing for variable costs and margin.
4. Add enterprise minimum commitments if needed.
5. Validate the full plan mix with the tier optimizer.

## Platform fee signals
- Too low: margins collapse when usage spikes.
- Too high: conversions drop in self-serve tiers.
- Misaligned: customers do not understand the value.

## Common mistakes
- Treating platform fees as hidden charges.
- Using the same fee for very different segments.
- Double-counting fixed costs in usage rates.
