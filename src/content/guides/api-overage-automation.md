## Quick checklist
- Define overage pricing in the rate card.
- Use alerts before the overage threshold.
- Set rate limits that match plan tiers.
- Automate upgrade prompts when limits are hit.
- Reconcile usage logs with billing data.

## Step-by-step
1. Set overage unit prices with margin guardrails.
2. Map tier limits to rate-limit settings.
3. Add alerts at 80% and 100% of usage.
4. Trigger upgrade or add-on prompts in product.
5. Review billing accuracy each month.

## What to watch
- Overages without clear in-product notices.
- Rate limits that block legitimate growth.
- Usage logs that lag billing by days.

## Common mistakes
- Mixing overage pricing with hidden caps.
- Throttling without an upgrade option.
- Missing alerts for admin users.
