## Quick checklist
- Set limits based on p50 activation usage.
- Keep limits visible in the product.
- Provide upgrade paths before limits hit.
- Avoid hard caps that block activation.
- Review trial conversion monthly.

## Step-by-step
1. Estimate activation usage for typical users.
2. Set a trial limit above that baseline.
3. Add alerts as users approach the limit.
4. Offer a clear upgrade CTA at 80%.
5. Review conversion and churn after changes.

## What to watch
- Limits that are too low for power users.
- Hidden limits that cause surprise blocks.
- Trial abuse without fair-use rules.

## Common mistakes
- Using the same limit across all segments.
- Not aligning limits to value metric.
- Blocking key features before activation.
