## Quick checklist
- Use a target range, not a single number.
- Segment margin targets by product line and customer size.
- Include third-party pass-through costs in COGS.
- Validate margin targets against competitors.
- Refresh targets quarterly.

## Step-by-step
1. Calculate blended unit cost from infra and vendor costs.
2. Add fixed overhead to understand all-in cost.
3. Choose a target gross margin range (for example 70-90%).
4. Validate against competitive pricing and value delivered.
5. Adjust pricing tiers to keep p90 usage within the target range.

## Example targets
- **Self-serve SaaS**: 75-85% gross margin.
- **API products**: 70-85% depending on pass-through costs.
- **Infra-heavy products**: 60-75% when costs are high.

## Common mistakes
- Picking a target without cost data.
- Using a single margin target across very different products.
- Ignoring how gross margin changes at high usage.
