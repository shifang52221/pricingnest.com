## Quick checklist
- Lead with your value metric, not feature counts.
- Highlight a single competitive advantage per plan.
- Use comparison tables sparingly.
- Keep proof near the primary CTA.
- Avoid naming competitors directly.

## Step-by-step
1. Identify the top two alternatives buyers compare you with.
2. Define one differentiator per tier.
3. Align plan copy to that differentiator.
4. Add a short "why us" section under the plans.
5. Validate messaging with sales calls.

## What to watch
- Over-comparison can backfire on trust.
- Too many claims reduce clarity.
- Positioning that conflicts with sales decks.

## Common mistakes
- Copying competitor pricing structure.
- Using vague claims like "best value."
- Burying the value metric in footnotes.
