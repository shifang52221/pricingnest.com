## Quick checklist
- Use names that imply progression in value.
- Avoid internal jargon and role titles.
- Keep names short and easy to scan.
- Align names to the value metric.
- Match names to your target segments.

## Step-by-step
1. Identify the value ladder from starter to enterprise.
2. Map each tier to a distinct buyer type or use case.
3. Draft three naming options per tier.
4. Test names with internal sales or support.
5. Pair names with a one-line plan summary.

## What to watch
- Names that over-promise can increase churn.
- Naming by features can date quickly.
- Too many tiers can dilute the naming signal.

## Common mistakes
- Using "Basic" and "Pro" without clear meaning.
- Renaming tiers during a migration without a plan.
- Copying competitor names without fit.
