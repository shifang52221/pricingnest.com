## Quick checklist
- Separate storage volume from request costs.
- Track hot vs cold storage mixes.
- Include retrieval and egress fees.
- Recalculate unit costs quarterly.
- Pass savings into pricing adjustments.

## Step-by-step
1. Estimate GB-month volume by tier.
2. Add request and retrieval fees.
3. Convert to a blended cost per GB-month.
4. Compare costs to pricing thresholds.
5. Re-run pricing after cost reductions.

## Optimization levers
- Reduce retention windows for non-critical data.
- Use lifecycle policies for cold storage.
- Compress or deduplicate large datasets.

## Common mistakes
- Ignoring retrieval fees in cost estimates.
- Mixing storage and bandwidth in one model.
- Using list prices instead of committed rates.
