## Quick checklist
- Normalize annual contracts to monthly MRR (ACV / 12).
- Keep usage revenue separate if it is volatile.
- Report run-rate ARR, not booked revenue.
- Document discount treatment in your MRR definition.
- Use one definition across finance and product.

## Step-by-step
1. Convert annual contracts to MRR using ACV / 12.
2. Add monthly subscriptions to get total MRR.
3. Multiply MRR by 12 to report ARR.
4. Exclude one-time fees and non-recurring services.
5. Validate ARR against finance reporting.

## Example scenarios
- **Annual prepay**: 120k annual contract becomes 10k MRR and 120k ARR.
- **Usage overages**: use a trailing average for MRR if usage is spiky.
- **Discounted contracts**: use net revenue, not list price.

## Common mistakes
- Counting booked revenue as ARR.
- Mixing gross and net MRR definitions.
- Including one-time setup fees in MRR.
