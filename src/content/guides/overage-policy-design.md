## Quick checklist
- Define overage pricing clearly on the pricing page.
- Add alerts before customers hit a cap.
- Use fair-use policies only for abusive usage.
- Model overage exposure by segment.
- Avoid hidden or surprise fees.

## Step-by-step
1. Set included usage by tier.
2. Define overage rates per unit.
3. Model bill variance for high-usage cohorts.
4. Add usage alerts and upgrade prompts.
5. Review overage revenue vs churn risk.

## Good policy traits
- Predictable bills with simple math.
- Clear upgrade paths when usage spikes.
- Consistent enforcement of caps and fair use.

## Common mistakes
- Setting overage rates without cost coverage.
- Using ambiguous fair-use language.
- Surprising customers after billing cycles end.
