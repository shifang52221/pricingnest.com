## Quick checklist
- Map value to either seats (users) or usage (units).
- Model at least two scenarios (p50 vs p90 usage per seat).
- Use a minimum fee to cover fixed overhead.
- Publish example bills for both models.
- Keep unit definitions consistent across plans.

## Step-by-step
1. Estimate blended unit cost and seat value contribution.
2. Add fixed overhead you need to recover.
3. Pick a target gross margin range.
4. Compare seat pricing vs usage pricing across scenarios.
5. Validate outputs with CSV exports and shareable links.

## Example scenarios
- **Collaboration tool**: seat pricing is predictable and aligns with value per user.
- **API product**: usage pricing aligns with cost and value per call.
- **Hybrid model**: base fee + seats + usage for heavy workflows.

## Common mistakes
- Using list price instead of realized price with discounts.
- Ignoring usage variability per seat.
- Overlooking minimum fees for low-usage customers.
