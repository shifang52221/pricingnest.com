## Quick checklist
- Separate list price from discount scenarios.
- Model base, upside, and downside terms.
- Align contract value with procurement limits.
- Keep term length consistent in reporting.
- Reconcile with finance definitions.

## Step-by-step
1. Convert plan prices to MRR and ARR.
2. Multiply by contract length for TCV.
3. Add minimum commitments if required.
4. Test a discount range for sales flexibility.
5. Publish a contract value range by tier.

## What to watch
- Long terms inflate TCV without improving margin.
- Discounts can erase ARR gains quickly.
- Add-ons should be modeled separately.

## Common mistakes
- Mixing one-time fees into contract value.
- Comparing contracts with different terms.
- Ignoring renewal rate impact.
