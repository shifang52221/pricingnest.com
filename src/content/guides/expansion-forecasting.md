## Quick checklist
- Separate expansion from new logo growth.
- Track expansion rates by cohort and plan.
- Set conservative and aggressive scenarios.
- Validate against last quarter trends.
- Review expansion drivers monthly.

## Step-by-step
1. Identify top expansion paths (upsell, add-on, usage).
2. Estimate expansion rates per plan.
3. Model impact on NRR and MRR.
4. Stress-test with a downside scenario.
5. Tie expansion targets to product triggers.

## What to watch
- Expansion concentrated in a few accounts.
- Discounts that distort expansion math.
- Mixing usage growth with upsell revenue.

## Common mistakes
- Forecasting expansion without a sales motion.
- Using average expansion across all segments.
- Ignoring renewal timing for upsells.
