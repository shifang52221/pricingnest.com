## Quick checklist
- Explain the unit and show a usage example.
- Provide a starter forecast in-product.
- Add usage alerts before overages.
- Show a clear upgrade path in the UI.
- Offer guidance for first 30 days.

## Step-by-step
1. Define the unit with a simple example.
2. Generate a default usage forecast for new users.
3. Add alerts at 50%, 80%, and 100% usage.
4. Provide a one-click upgrade or add-on path.
5. Review onboarding outcomes monthly.

## What to watch
- New users without a baseline forecast.
- Alert fatigue from too many notices.
- Confusing unit names that slow activation.

## Common mistakes
- Sending pricing emails without in-product context.
- Hiding overage rules until the first invoice.
- Using too many units across features.
