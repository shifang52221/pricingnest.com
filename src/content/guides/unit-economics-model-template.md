## Quick checklist
- Define your unit of value (seat, call, GB-month).
- Separate variable costs from fixed overhead.
- Include churn, ARPA, and CAC in the model.
- Use at least two scenarios (p50 vs p90).
- Revisit the model quarterly.

## Step-by-step
1. Define the unit and write down assumptions.
2. Estimate blended unit costs (infra + vendor pass-through).
3. Add fixed overhead you need to recover.
4. Calculate gross margin and contribution margin.
5. Add CAC and payback targets.
6. Validate outputs with real billing data.

## Example model sections
- **Revenue**: ARPA, plan mix, expansion.
- **Costs**: infra, vendor fees, support, onboarding.
- **Retention**: churn, expansion, net retention.
- **Acquisition**: CAC, payback, channel mix.

## Common mistakes
- Ignoring support costs that scale with customer count.
- Mixing gross and net churn assumptions.
- Failing to update cost inputs after vendor pricing changes.
