## Quick checklist
- Keep the plan cards above the fold on desktop and mobile.
- Use a single primary CTA per card.
- Put unit definitions beside pricing, not in footnotes.
- Add a short comparison table below the cards.
- Make FAQs collapsible to reduce scroll fatigue.

## Step-by-step
1. Sketch the page in three blocks: plans, comparison, and FAQ.
2. Place the value metric and included usage in the plan header.
3. Add two proof points near the CTA (security or uptime).
4. Show annual vs monthly toggle near the price.
5. Test the layout on a phone screen width.

## What to watch
- Sticky headers can hide plan details on mobile.
- Long plan cards push the CTA out of view.
- Dense tables reduce scan speed and hurt clarity.

## Common mistakes
- Hiding usage units in tooltip-only UI.
- Mixing plan names with audience names.
- Splitting the primary CTA into multiple buttons.
