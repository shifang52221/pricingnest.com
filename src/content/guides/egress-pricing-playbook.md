## Quick checklist
- Use blended egress cost per GB.
- Add a margin buffer for p90 traffic.
- Tier prices to reduce bill shock.
- Separate CDN and origin costs.
- Review bandwidth costs quarterly.

## Step-by-step
1. Estimate blended egress cost per GB.
2. Model usage at p50 and p90.
3. Add a margin buffer to the unit price.
4. Build tiered pricing for large volumes.
5. Validate against real customer workloads.

## What to watch
- Ignoring burst traffic in modeling.
- Using list prices instead of blended costs.
- Overusing flat-rate plans for bandwidth.

## Common mistakes
- Pricing bandwidth below cost.
- Hiding egress fees in fine print.
- Forgetting to include CDN pass-through.
