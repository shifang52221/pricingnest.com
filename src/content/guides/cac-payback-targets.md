## Quick checklist
- Separate payback targets by channel and segment.
- Use contribution margin if onboarding or support costs are material.
- Account for sales cycle length and ramp time.
- Compare payback targets against cash runway.
- Recalculate quarterly as CAC and churn shift.

## Step-by-step
1. Calculate gross profit per month from ARPA and margin.
2. Estimate CAC by channel and segment.
3. Decide a target payback window (6-12 months is common).
4. Compare payback to cash flow and growth goals.
5. Adjust pricing or acquisition if payback is too long.

## Example targets
- **SMB self-serve**: 6-9 months.
- **Mid-market sales-led**: 9-12 months.
- **Enterprise**: 12-18 months when contracts are sticky.

## Common mistakes
- Using blended CAC across channels.
- Ignoring onboarding ramp time for revenue.
- Comparing payback without churn context.
