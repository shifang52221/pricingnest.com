## Quick checklist
- Define the unit and write down assumptions.
- Model at least two scenarios (p50 vs p90).
- Use a minimum/platform fee if fixed overhead is meaningful.
- Publish examples to reduce bill shock and support load.
## Step-by-step
1. Estimate your blended unit costs (infra + vendor pass-through).
2. Add fixed overhead you need to recover.
3. Pick a target gross margin range.
4. Choose tiers and included usage based on typical and heavy customers.
5. Validate outputs with a CSV export and shareable links.
