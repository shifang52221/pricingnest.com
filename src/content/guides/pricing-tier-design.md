## Quick checklist
- Pick a target ARPA aligned with margin and CAC payback.
- Define the expected plan mix by segment.
- Set multipliers based on value differences.
- Validate prices against willingness-to-pay research.
- Re-run after packaging changes or market shifts.

## Step-by-step
1. Define your tier names and value metric.
2. Set the expected mix for Basic, Pro, and Enterprise.
3. Use multipliers to reflect value differentiation.
4. Solve for prices and compare to competitor ranges.
5. Stress-test a mix shift (more Pro, fewer Basic).

## Pricing signals
- If Basic is too low, ARPA will never reach target.
- If Enterprise is too low, high-touch costs may be underpriced.
- If Pro is too high, upgrades may stall.

## Common mistakes
- Using list prices without discount assumptions.
- Ignoring support and success costs for Enterprise.
- Using the same value metric across unrelated customer segments.
- Setting too many tiers that overlap.
