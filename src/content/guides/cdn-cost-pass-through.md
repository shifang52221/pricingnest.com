## Quick checklist
- Separate CDN vs origin costs.
- Set pass-through thresholds by tier.
- Use a simple per-GB rate for clarity.
- Add caps for extreme traffic.
- Review CDN usage quarterly.

## Step-by-step
1. Calculate blended CDN cost per GB.
2. Decide which tiers include CDN usage.
3. Set overage rates for high usage.
4. Add alerts before pass-through fees apply.
5. Monitor churn after changes.

## What to watch
- Hidden CDN costs erode margin.
- Overly complex pass-through harms conversion.
- Regional egress rates can skew pricing.

## Common mistakes
- Mixing CDN and storage costs.
- Passing costs without clear disclosure.
- Ignoring cache hit rate changes.
