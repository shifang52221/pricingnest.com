## Quick checklist
- Separate new revenue from existing customer revenue.
- Measure expansion, contraction, and churn monthly.
- Track NRR by cohort or segment.
- Set an NRR target per product line.
- Align success plans with expansion levers.

## Step-by-step
1. Input starting MRR from existing customers only.
2. Add expansion, contraction, and churned MRR.
3. Review NRR and net revenue change.
4. Segment by plan or customer size to find weak cohorts.
5. Map expansion playbooks to teams and timelines.

## Expansion levers
- Seat growth or usage growth
- Tier upgrades or packaging unlocks
- Add-ons tied to new workflows
- Annual prepay upgrades

## Contraction and churn risks
- Feature gaps vs competitors
- Pricing too high for low-usage customers
- Poor onboarding or low activation
- Misaligned value metric

## Common mistakes
- Including new customer MRR in NRR.
- Mixing bookings or billings with MRR.
- Using annual churn in a monthly model.
- Ignoring contraction trends until churn spikes.
