## Quick checklist
- Define migration cohorts (new, existing, enterprise).
- Decide on grandfathering or phased rollout.
- Estimate churn risk per segment.
- Communicate value changes clearly.
- Track downgrade and churn during rollout.

## Step-by-step
1. Model new tier prices and expected mix.
2. Map each current customer to a new tier.
3. Estimate price deltas and churn risk.
4. Choose migration timing and discounts.
5. Monitor churn and expansion after launch.

## Migration guardrails
- High-risk segments need longer notice periods.
- Enterprise accounts require custom communication.
- Limit changes to one primary value metric.

## Common mistakes
- Migrating all customers at once.
- Ignoring support load from plan confusion.
- Overlapping tier limits that reduce upgrades.
