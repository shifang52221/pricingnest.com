## Quick checklist
- Separate billing timing from revenue recognition.
- Keep ARR and MRR definitions consistent.
- Align discounting with finance rules.
- Document recognition assumptions.
- Review with finance before major changes.

## Step-by-step
1. Map billing cycles to revenue recognition timing.
2. Confirm ARR and MRR definitions.
3. Translate contract value into recognized revenue.
4. Track deferred revenue for annual contracts.
5. Update pricing models with finance inputs.

## What to watch
- Annual prepay inflates cash but not revenue.
- Discounting changes recognition schedules.
- One-time fees need separate treatment.

## Common mistakes
- Treating TCV as ARR.
- Ignoring deferred revenue impacts.
- Mixing contract length in reports.
