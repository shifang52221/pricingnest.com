## Quick checklist
- Define the target discount range (10-20% is common).
- Decide whether cash flow or churn reduction is the primary goal.
- Model break-even churn impact before setting the discount.
- Segment discounts by customer size if needed.
- Publish effective monthly price to reduce confusion.

## Step-by-step
1. Choose a baseline monthly price and target discount.
2. Calculate annual price and effective monthly rate.
3. Estimate churn reduction or renewal uplift from prepay.
4. Compare cash flow benefit vs revenue discount.
5. Validate outcomes against gross margin and support costs.

## Example scenarios
- **SMB discount**: 15% off annual to improve cash flow and reduce churn.
- **Mid-market discount**: 10% off annual with a minimum spend requirement.
- **Enterprise prepay**: custom discount tied to multi-year commitment.

## Common mistakes
- Using one discount across all segments without price sensitivity data.
- Offering discounts so high they erode margin.
- Hiding effective monthly rate, which confuses buyers.
