## Quick checklist
- Define the usage unit and the included amount for the base tier.
- Model at least two scenarios (p50 vs p90 usage).
- Use a platform fee to recover fixed overhead.
- Make tier thresholds visible on the pricing page.
- Publish example bills for typical and heavy users.

## Step-by-step
1. Estimate blended unit costs (infra + vendor pass-through).
2. Add fixed overhead you need to recover.
3. Set a target gross margin range.
4. Choose tier breakpoints based on usage distribution (p50, p75, p90).
5. Validate outputs with CSV exports and shareable links.

## Example scenarios
- **Starter tier**: base fee + included usage to keep entry prices predictable.
- **Growth tier**: lower per-unit prices beyond tier 1 to reward volume.
- **Enterprise tier**: larger commitments with custom pricing above tier 3.

## Common mistakes
- Making tiers so small that customers hit overages immediately.
- Flattening prices across tiers so heavy users are subsidized.
- Forgetting to include a platform fee for fixed costs.
