## Quick checklist
- Separate core value from premium value.
- Keep 3 to 5 differentiators per plan.
- Use limits to signal who each plan is for.
- Keep upgrade paths obvious.
- Validate differentiation against support load.

## Step-by-step
1. List all features and usage limits.
2. Tag each item as core, premium, or enterprise.
3. Build a matrix that steps up value by plan.
4. Validate the matrix against margin targets.
5. Test with a sales or support review.

## What to watch
- Too many differentiators make plans hard to parse.
- Missing mid-tier value causes plan skipping.
- Feature gating without usage guidance creates friction.

## Common mistakes
- Putting all value in the top plan.
- Copying a competitor matrix without costs.
- Changing plan steps without updating the pricing page.
