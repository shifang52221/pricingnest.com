## Quick checklist
- Tie the metric to measurable customer value.
- Confirm the metric scales with cost.
- Keep the unit simple to explain on pricing pages.
- Test against ARPA targets.
- Validate with customer interviews.

## Step-by-step
1. List the top outcomes customers pay for.
2. Map each outcome to a measurable usage unit.
3. Check cost alignment for that unit.
4. Model prices and tiers with the unit.
5. Stress-test with a high-usage cohort.

## What to watch
- Metrics that are too abstract create pricing friction.
- Metrics that only track cost limit expansion.
- Mixed metrics across tiers confuse upgrades.

## Common mistakes
- Choosing internal cost units customers do not see.
- Using multiple primary metrics on one page.
- Ignoring segment differences in value.
