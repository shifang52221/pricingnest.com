## Quick checklist
- Define rate limits by plan.
- Align limits with usage pricing tiers.
- Use throttling for abuse protection.
- Offer paid upgrades at higher limits.
- Track limit hits by segment.

## Step-by-step
1. Estimate cost per 1,000 calls.
2. Set rate limits by tier and segment.
3. Add upgrade prompts at limit thresholds.
4. Model revenue impact of higher limits.
5. Review limits after traffic growth.

## What to watch
- Too-low limits block activation.
- Too-high limits create cost spikes.
- Rate limits without clear messaging cause churn.

## Common mistakes
- Using rate limits as a pricing substitute.
- Ignoring burst traffic in limit design.
