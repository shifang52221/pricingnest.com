## Quick checklist
- Segment renewals by billing cycle.
- Track renewal rates by cohort.
- Separate churn from contraction.
- Validate forecast against recent trends.
- Review renewal risk monthly.

## Step-by-step
1. Build cohorts by signup month and plan.
2. Calculate renewal rates for each cycle.
3. Estimate churn impact on MRR and NRR.
4. Add expansion assumptions by segment.
5. Compare forecast to actuals each month.

## What to watch
- Mixing logo churn with revenue churn.
- Using last quarter averages without seasonality.
- Ignoring renewal timing within the month.

## Common mistakes
- Treating annual and monthly renewals the same.
- Ignoring plan migrations near renewal dates.
- Forecasting without a churn review process.
