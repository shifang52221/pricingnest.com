## Quick checklist
- Show a short proof section near the plans.
- Clarify billing cycle and renewal terms.
- Link to security or compliance details.
- State cancellation and refund rules plainly.
- Add a short FAQ for top objections.

## Step-by-step
1. List the top three trust gaps from sales calls.
2. Add a proof block (logos, metrics, or quotes).
3. Place billing cycle and renewal terms beside pricing.
4. Add a short policy note for cancellation.
5. Review for clarity with a non-technical reader.

## What to watch
- Too much proof can look like clutter.
- Hidden policy links create distrust.
- Vague terms like "billed annually" without dates.

## Common mistakes
- Overloading the page with badges.
- Splitting policy details across multiple pages.
- Using legal language instead of plain terms.
