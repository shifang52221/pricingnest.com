## Quick checklist
- Tie milestones to value delivery.
- Introduce pricing only after activation.
- Keep prompts short and contextual.
- Offer a clear upgrade path.
- Track milestone conversion rates.

## Step-by-step
1. Define three onboarding milestones.
2. Map each milestone to a pricing or usage step.
3. Add in-product prompts after each milestone.
4. Measure conversion and retention impact.
5. Iterate monthly based on outcomes.

## What to watch
- Prompts that appear before value is clear.
- Too many milestones that slow onboarding.
- Misalignment with the value metric.

## Common mistakes
- Using generic prompts for all segments.
- Forcing upgrades before activation.
- Ignoring churn impact after changes.
