## Quick checklist
- Monitor month-1 and month-3 retention.

- Segment by plan and acquisition channel.
- Use leading indicators for proactive outreach.
- Review churn impact weekly during launches.

## Step-by-step
1. Plot retention curves for the last 6 cohorts.
2. Flag the steepest drop-off month.
3. Compare retention to NRR for the same cohort.
4. Quantify revenue at risk using churn impact.
5. Prioritize fixes in onboarding and activation.

## Early warning signals
- Month-1 retention dips after pricing changes.
- NRR flatlines despite expansion efforts.
- High churn concentration in one plan.

## Common mistakes
- Mixing trial and paid cohorts.
- Comparing retention curves with different cohort definitions.
- Ignoring product changes between cohorts.
