## Quick checklist
- Define benchmark cohorts by segment.
- Track month-1 and month-3 retention.
- Compare NRR alongside retention curves.
- Use benchmarks to set pricing guardrails.
- Update benchmarks quarterly.

## Step-by-step
1. Select a baseline cohort with stable pricing.
2. Plot retention and NRR over 6 months.
3. Compare new cohorts to the baseline.
4. Flag deviations after pricing changes.
5. Adjust tiers or onboarding as needed.

## What to watch
- Benchmarks drift after product changes.
- Over-indexing on averages hides segment risk.
- Retention and NRR can diverge.

## Common mistakes
- Using different cohort definitions each month.
- Ignoring seasonality.
- Comparing new segments to legacy baselines.
