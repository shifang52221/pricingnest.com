## Quick checklist
- Trigger alerts at 70%, 90%, and 100% usage.
- Use clear upgrade calls to action.
- Include projected bill impact.
- Align alerts with tier thresholds.
- Localize alerts for global customers.

## Step-by-step
1. Define usage thresholds by tier.
2. Estimate bill impact at each threshold.
3. Add upgrade prompts and links.
4. Monitor alert engagement rates.
5. Adjust thresholds after usage shifts.

## What to watch
- Late alerts cause bill shock.
- Too many alerts create noise.
- Missing usage context reduces action.

## Common mistakes
- Using one threshold across all tiers.
- Hiding alerts in email only.
- Ignoring enterprise notification needs.
