## Quick checklist
- Separate compute, storage, and bandwidth costs.
- Allocate shared costs with a clear method.
- Normalize costs per usage unit.
- Track cost changes by service.
- Update pricing floors after cost shifts.

## Step-by-step
1. Split infra costs by service category.
2. Allocate shared overhead using usage ratios.
3. Convert totals into per-unit costs.
4. Compare against pricing and margins.
5. Update cost baselines quarterly.

## What to watch
- Blended costs hide expensive services.
- Over-allocating shared costs skews pricing.
- Missing data leads to underpricing.

## Common mistakes
- Treating all usage as equal cost.
- Ignoring vendor commitments.
- Skipping cost allocation updates.
