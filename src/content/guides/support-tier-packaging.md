## Quick checklist
- Match support tiers to response time needs.
- Price support to recover staffing costs.
- Limit premium support to higher tiers.
- Offer support as an add-on for mid tiers.
- Define support coverage and exclusions.

## Step-by-step
1. Segment customers by support intensity.
2. Estimate support cost per tier.
3. Create a standard and premium support tier.
4. Add support SLAs and escalation rules.
5. Review support ticket volume monthly.

## What to watch
- Premium support bundled into low tiers.
- Vague SLA language that creates disputes.
- Underpricing support add-ons.

## Common mistakes
- Treating support as a free feature.
- Promising 24x7 without staffing coverage.
- Hiding support tiers behind sales-only docs.
