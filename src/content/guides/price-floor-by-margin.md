## Quick checklist
- Base floors on unit cost, not list price.
- Use contribution margin targets.
- Include p90 usage overhead.
- Keep floors consistent across tiers.
- Review after infra cost changes.

## Step-by-step
1. Estimate unit cost per usage unit.
2. Apply target gross margin.
3. Add a buffer for peak usage.
4. Compare floors to current pricing.
5. Update tiers or minimums if needed.

## What to watch
- Underpriced floors create negative margins.
- Floors that are too high reduce conversion.
- Cost variance can break pricing assumptions.

## Common mistakes
- Ignoring request and support costs.
- Using averages instead of p90 costs.
- Mixing fixed and variable costs.
