## Quick checklist
- Keep expiration rules simple and visible.
- Offer clear reminders before expiration.
- Align credits with usage billing cycles.
- Avoid expiration windows under 30 days.
- Provide a renewal path for unused credits.

## Step-by-step
1. Define credit validity windows by plan.
2. Add reminders at 30 and 7 days.
3. Show remaining credits in the dashboard.
4. Align credit usage with the rate card.
5. Review churn impact after changes.

## What to watch
- Credits expiring too quickly.
- Confusing rules across plans.
- Credits that hide the unit cost.

## Common mistakes
- Hiding expiration in legal docs only.
- Allowing credits to bypass caps.
- Not showing credit usage in-product.
