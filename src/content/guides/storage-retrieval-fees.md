## Quick checklist
- Separate storage and retrieval costs.
- Include request fees in estimates.
- Use a blended cost for pricing.
- Recalculate after usage shifts.
- Document assumptions clearly.

## Step-by-step
1. Estimate retrieval volume by tier.
2. Calculate retrieval fees per GB.
3. Add retrieval costs to storage unit cost.
4. Compare to pricing floors.
5. Update tiers or overage rates.

## What to watch
- Cold storage retrieval spikes.
- Regional fee differences.
- Retrieval costs hidden in COGS.

## Common mistakes
- Ignoring retrieval fees in pricing.
- Mixing retrieval and bandwidth costs.
- Using list prices instead of blended rates.
