## Quick checklist
- Define the unit in one sentence with a concrete example.
- Describe what is included and excluded in the unit.
- Show a buyer-friendly conversion (per 1,000, per GB-month).
- Publish example bills for light, typical, and heavy usage.
- Keep unit names consistent across pricing page, docs, and invoices.

## Step-by-step
1. Pick the smallest measurable unit that matches value (request, event, GB-month).
2. Define the unit in plain language with a real-world example.
3. Add included usage and overage pricing to reduce bill shock.
4. Align unit pricing with actual cost drivers and margin targets.
5. Validate with a CSV export and shareable links.

## Example definitions
- **Request**: one API call that returns a response under 1 MB.
- **Event**: one tracked action, such as a button click or page view.
- **GB-month**: average gigabytes stored for a full month.

## Common mistakes
- Using vague units like credits without a conversion.
- Changing unit definitions across plans or regions.
- Pricing per unit without showing a sample bill.
