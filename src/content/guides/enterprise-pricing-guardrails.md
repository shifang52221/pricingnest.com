## Quick checklist
- Define a minimum enterprise price band.
- Limit discount ranges and approval paths.
- Bundle implementation and support costs.
- Require multi-year commitments for heavy usage.
- Track margin by account tier.

## Step-by-step
1. Build a baseline enterprise plan with guardrails.
2. Add minimum platform fee or commitment.
3. Set discount and exception thresholds.
4. Model churn risk for price changes.
5. Review guardrails quarterly.

## What to watch
- Unbounded discounts erode margin quickly.
- Custom terms slow down deal cycles.
- High support costs need explicit pricing.

## Common mistakes
- Treating enterprise as a one-off plan.
- Ignoring post-sale expansion potential.
- Overusing exceptions without tracking them.
