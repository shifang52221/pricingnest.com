## Quick checklist
- Minimum commitment matches buyer budget bands.
- Drawdown rules are simple and visible.
- Overages use the same unit pricing.
- Credits align to the rate card.
- Legal terms match billing behavior.

## Step-by-step
1. Define commitment levels by segment size.
2. Map drawdown to a simple unit price list.
3. Set overage pricing that protects margin.
4. Add renewal terms and ramp policies.
5. Validate outcomes with a p90 usage model.

## What to watch
- Commitments that are too high for mid-market.
- Complex drawdown rules that confuse buyers.
- Hidden fees that create renewal churn.

## Common mistakes
- Using a commit without a clear unit definition.
- Letting overages bypass the rate card.
- Forgetting to align sales quotes and billing.
