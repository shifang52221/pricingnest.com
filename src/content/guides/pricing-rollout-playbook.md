## Quick checklist
- Segment customers by price sensitivity.
- Decide on grandfathering vs phased rollout.
- Model churn impact and revenue lift.
- Align comms with value upgrades.
- Track downgrade signals during rollout.

## Step-by-step
1. Model price increase impact by segment.
2. Choose rollout cohorts and timing.
3. Set exception rules for key accounts.
4. Publish clear pricing change messaging.
5. Monitor churn and downgrade rates weekly.

## What to watch
- High churn in small tiers signals mispricing.
- Late communication spikes downgrade risk.
- Broad rollouts increase support load.

## Common mistakes
- Rolling out without a baseline cohort.
- Ignoring downgrades as early churn signals.
- Applying the same increase across all tiers.
