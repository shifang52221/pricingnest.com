## Quick checklist
- Track seats per account by plan.
- Separate seat expansion from new logos.
- Model churn impact of seat price changes.
- Compare seat expansion to usage expansion.
- Set guardrails for minimum seat counts.

## Step-by-step
1. Export seat counts per account and plan.
2. Estimate seat expansion rate per segment.
3. Model price changes per seat and churn impact.
4. Compare seat pricing to usage pricing alternatives.
5. Translate seat expansion into MRR growth.

## Expansion signals
- Rapid seat growth means expansion is healthy.
- Flat seats but rising usage may favor usage pricing.
- High seat churn suggests the price per seat is too high.

## Common mistakes
- Using averages instead of segment splits.
- Ignoring seat minimums for enterprise accounts.
- Not syncing seat data with billing.
