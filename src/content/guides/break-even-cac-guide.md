## Quick checklist
- Pick a realistic payback target (6-18 months).
- Use a gross margin that matches finance reporting.
- Convert churn to monthly churn for consistent math.
- Compare break-even CAC to current blended CAC.

## Step-by-step
1. Input ARPA, gross margin, and churn.
2. Set a payback target based on cash flow needs.
3. Compute break-even CAC and LTV:CAC.
4. Compare to current CAC by channel or segment.
5. Tighten pricing or retention if break-even CAC is too low.

## Benchmarks
- Early-stage SaaS often targets 12-18 month payback.
- Mature SaaS tends to target 6-12 month payback.
- LTV:CAC below 2 usually signals retention or margin issues.

## Common mistakes
- Using annual churn while modeling monthly payback.
- Ignoring gross margin and using revenue instead of gross profit.
- Averaging CAC across channels with very different payback profiles.

## How to improve break-even CAC
- Increase ARPA with packaging or seat expansion.
- Raise gross margin by lowering variable COGS.
- Reduce churn through onboarding and support improvements.
- Shorten payback by reducing sales cycle costs.
