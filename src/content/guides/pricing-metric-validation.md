## Quick checklist
- Metric correlates with value and cost.
- Buyers can estimate it without a spreadsheet.
- Metric is measurable in your product.
- Heavy users still clear margin targets.
- Metric does not block product adoption.

## Step-by-step
1. Map the metric to your primary value outcome.
2. Calculate unit cost for p50 and p90 users.
3. Test the metric against margin guardrails.
4. Run a buyer interview on metric clarity.
5. Validate tracking and billing accuracy.

## What to watch
- Metrics that are easy to game.
- Units buyers do not understand.
- Metrics that change too often month to month.

## Common mistakes
- Pricing on the cheapest internal cost driver.
- Mixing multiple metrics in one plan.
- Ignoring billing system limitations.
