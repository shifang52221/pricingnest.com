## Quick checklist
- Keep add-ons tied to a clear value driver.
- Avoid bundling add-ons across unrelated tiers.
- Price add-ons for margin and attach rate.
- Model expansion impact on NRR.
- Review add-on performance quarterly.

## Step-by-step
1. Identify features that drive expansion.
2. Choose per-unit or flat fee pricing.
3. Model the attach rate and ARPA impact.
4. Validate add-on costs and margin.
5. Update tiers to avoid overlap.

## What to watch
- Add-ons that overlap tier limits reduce upgrades.
- Too many add-ons dilute value messaging.
- Pricing add-ons below cost drives churn.

## Common mistakes
- Hiding core features behind add-ons.
- Ignoring support and onboarding effort.
- Mixing add-on revenue into base MRR.
