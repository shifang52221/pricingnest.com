## Quick checklist
- Define soft and hard caps per plan.
- Add alert thresholds before overages.
- Use tiers to smooth unexpected spikes.
- Document fair-use and abuse policies.
- Review spike patterns monthly.

## Step-by-step
1. Identify the p90 usage level per segment.
2. Set alert thresholds at 80% and 100%.
3. Add caps that prevent runaway bills.
4. Provide a self-serve upgrade path.
5. Review churn and support tickets after changes.

## What to watch
- Caps that cut off core workflows.
- Overly aggressive throttling.
- Alerts that do not reach decision-makers.

## Common mistakes
- Using a cap without clear communication.
- Leaving out usage alerts or dashboards.
- Setting caps lower than included usage.
