## Quick checklist
- Anchor included usage to activation milestones.
- Keep included amounts easy to remember.
- Align limits with tier upgrade targets.
- Model overage exposure for heavy users.
- Update after usage distribution shifts.

## Step-by-step
1. Pull p50 and p90 usage by segment.
2. Choose included usage for each tier.
3. Price overages above the included threshold.
4. Validate ARPA and margin targets.
5. Add alerts before customers hit caps.

## What to watch
- Too low included usage triggers early churn.
- Too high included usage stalls upgrades.
- Overlapping limits create tier confusion.

## Common mistakes
- Basing included usage on cost alone.
- Ignoring seasonality in usage.
- Using different units across tiers.
