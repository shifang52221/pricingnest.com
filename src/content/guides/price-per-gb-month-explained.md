## Quick checklist
- Explain GB-month in one sentence with a numeric example.
- Show how averages work across the month.
- Include storage and request costs separately when needed.
- Publish sample bills for 100 GB, 1 TB, and 10 TB.
- Use a base fee if fixed overhead is meaningful.

## Step-by-step
1. Define GB-month and explain how daily storage averages roll up to monthly usage.
2. Estimate blended cost per GB-month using your actual storage mix.
3. Add fixed overhead and choose a target gross margin.
4. Set a base fee or included storage to protect margin at low usage.
5. Validate pricing with CSV exports and example bills.

## Example workloads
- **100 GB average**: starter tier with a small base fee.
- **1 TB average**: mid-tier storage with volume discount.
- **10 TB average**: enterprise tier with negotiated pricing.

## Common mistakes
- Using peak storage instead of monthly average.
- Hiding request pricing when it is material.
- Leaving out replication or backup overhead.
