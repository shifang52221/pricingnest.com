## Quick checklist
- Segment customers by price sensitivity (SMB vs mid-market vs enterprise).
- Calculate break-even churn for each segment before setting the increase.
- Decide whether to grandfather existing customers or migrate them.
- Prepare communication templates and timing by segment.
- Run a pilot cohort before a full rollout.

## Step-by-step
1. Define the current price and the target increase (percent or fixed).
2. Estimate expected churn from the increase by segment.
3. Calculate break-even churn and compare it to expected churn.
4. Choose rollout options: new customers only, renewals only, or all customers.
5. Prepare a downgrade path or value add to reduce churn risk.
6. Track retention, expansion, and support volume during the rollout.

## Example scenarios
- **SMB price increase**: 5-10% increase with higher churn risk; use clear messaging and support.
- **Enterprise uplift**: 3-5% increase at renewal with added value or service guarantees.
- **Packaging change**: adjust tiers and limits instead of a pure price increase.

## Communication essentials
- Lead with value delivered, not internal costs.
- Give advance notice (30-60 days for monthly plans; 90 days for annual).
- Offer a grace period or limited-time renewal option.

## Common mistakes
- Applying a single churn assumption across all segments.
- Rolling out to the entire base without a pilot.
- Raising price without improving perceived value.
