## Quick checklist
- Track downgrades separately from churn.
- Identify tiers with the highest contraction.
- Align value messaging with tier benefits.
- Review downgrades after price changes.
- Offer upgrade prompts before contract renewals.

## Step-by-step
1. Measure downgrade rate by plan.
2. Model revenue loss from downgrades.
3. Diagnose tier overlap or weak differentiation.
4. Adjust limits or value messaging.
5. Re-check net new MRR impact.

## What to watch
- Downgrades can signal Pro tier weakness.
- Discounts without value proof increase contraction.
- Price increases raise downgrade risk if value is unclear.

## Common mistakes
- Treating downgrades as churn.
- Ignoring downgrade reasons in surveys.
- Overlapping tier limits.
