## Quick checklist
- Define the experiment goal (revenue uplift, churn reduction, or cash flow).
- Segment customers by size and contract term.
- Set success metrics and guardrails before launch.
- Run a pilot cohort before full rollout.
- Document learnings for the next test.

## Step-by-step
1. Define the hypothesis and primary metric (MRR uplift, churn, or cash flow).
2. Choose the cohort and the pricing change (increase, discount, or packaging).
3. Estimate expected churn or conversion impact and set guardrails.
4. Run the test for a fixed window and collect feedback.
5. Roll out or revert based on results and support impact.

## Example experiments
- **Annual prepay test**: 10-15% discount for annual plans to improve cash flow.
- **Price increase test**: 5% increase at renewal for a single segment.
- **Packaging test**: move a feature to a higher tier to lift ARPA.

## Common mistakes
- Testing multiple variables at once without clear attribution.
- Using short test windows that miss renewal cycles.
- Ignoring support tickets and qualitative feedback.
