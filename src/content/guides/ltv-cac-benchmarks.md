## Quick checklist
- Use cohort-based churn, not a blended average.
- Separate gross vs net churn in your model.
- Align ARPA and margin to the same period.
- Compare LTV:CAC with payback months, not alone.
- Segment by plan or channel if ratios vary widely.

## Step-by-step
1. Calculate LTV from ARPA, gross margin, and churn.
2. Compare LTV to CAC for the same segment and channel.
3. Validate payback period and cash flow constraints.
4. Adjust assumptions if churn or ARPA is unstable.
5. Review the ratio quarterly as cohorts mature.

## Example benchmarks
- **<1x**: unsustainable unless churn improves fast.
- **2-3x**: common target range for SaaS.
- **>4x**: often indicates under-investment in growth or overly conservative churn assumptions.

## Common mistakes
- Mixing net churn with gross margin assumptions.
- Using sales-led CAC with self-serve ARPA.
- Ignoring ramp time or implementation delays.
