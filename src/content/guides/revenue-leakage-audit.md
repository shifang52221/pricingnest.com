## Quick checklist

- Review cancellations vs refunds.
- Check revenue recognition timing.
- Track leakage as a monthly metric.

## Step-by-step

2. Compare billed units to metered units.
3. Audit discounts, credits, and refunds.
4. Validate revenue recognition rules.
5. Document fixes and re-audit quarterly.

## What to watch
