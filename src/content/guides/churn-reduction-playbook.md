## Quick checklist
- Segment churn by plan and cohort.
- Compare churn impact to expansion lift.
- Focus on month-1 and month-3 retention.
- Tie fixes to onboarding and activation.
- Track churn weekly after pricing changes.

## Step-by-step
1. Plot retention curves for recent cohorts.
2. Identify the steepest churn drop-off.
3. Quantify revenue loss with churn impact.
4. Prioritize fixes by plan and segment.
5. Re-test NRR after changes.

## What to watch
- Expansion can hide rising churn.
- Early churn usually points to onboarding gaps.
- Churn concentrated in one tier signals mispricing.

## Common mistakes
- Using logo churn alone.
- Mixing trial and paid cohorts.
- Treating churn as a single global rate.
