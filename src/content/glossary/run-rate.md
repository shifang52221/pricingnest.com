## Definition
Run rate is a normalized revenue pace (such as MRR) used to project annualized performance.

## Why it matters
Run rate helps you compare periods and set targets, but it can mislead if revenue is seasonal or volatile.

## Pricing implications
Price changes affect run rate quickly, but you should validate against churn and cohort retention to avoid overestimating
long-term impact.

## Measurement tips
Use a stable month or a rolling average to avoid outliers.

## Checklist
- Use consistent definitions (MRR, ARR).
- Avoid using a single peak month as run rate.
- Separate run rate from bookings and cash collected.
- Normalize annual contracts to monthly equivalents.
- Use cohort churn to validate run-rate projections.
- Recompute run rate after pricing changes.
- Document the method in reporting dashboards.
- Align run rate with finance reporting cadence.
