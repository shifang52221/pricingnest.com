## Definition
Overage is the charge applied when a customer exceeds included usage or plan limits.

## Why it matters
Overage pricing affects customer trust and retention. Poorly designed overages cause bill shock and churn.

## Pricing implications
Use tiered overages, alerts, and caps to keep bills predictable. Set overage rates to protect margin on heavy usage.

## Measurement tips
Track overage revenue and churn following overage events.

## Checklist
- Define overage units and rates clearly.
- Publish example bills with overages.
- Use alerts before overages apply.
- Offer caps or commitments for heavy users.
- Monitor churn after overage spikes.
- Align overage pricing with cost drivers.
- Keep overage terms consistent across plans.
- Re-evaluate overage rates quarterly.
