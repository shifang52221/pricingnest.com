## Definition
Contract value is the value of a contract over its term, often expressed as TCV or ACV.

## Why it matters
Contract value informs sales forecasting, but it can diverge from ARR and recognized revenue.

## Pricing implications
Discounts and concessions reduce contract value and margin. Use contract value alongside retention metrics to avoid
over-optimism.

## Measurement tips
Track contract value by segment and term length.

## Checklist
- Separate TCV and ACV definitions clearly.
- Exclude non-recurring services if you report ARR.
- Track contract value by plan and segment.
- Normalize multi-year contracts for comparisons.
- Reconcile contract value with billing systems.
- Document discount policies.
- Avoid mixing contract value with recognized revenue.
- Use contract value for sales pipeline reporting.
