## Definition
Storage measured as average GB stored over a month (GB × time).
## Why it matters
Storage and infra pricing gets messy fast. A clear definition helps you model cost recovery and explain pricing to buyers.
## Common pitfalls
- Ignoring request costs and focusing only on GB-month.
- Using raw provider list prices instead of blended costs.
- Not modeling p90 customers who drive most cost.
