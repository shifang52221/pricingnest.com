## Definition
Activation is the point where a user reaches the first meaningful outcome from your product.

## Why it matters
Activation is the strongest predictor of retention and upgrade intent. It also influences how you design trials,
onboarding, and free tiers.

## Pricing implications
If activation takes time or heavy setup, longer trials or guided onboarding can be more effective than discounts. If it
happens quickly, usage gates and paid upgrades can move earlier in the journey.

## How to measure
Define one primary activation event and time-to-activation, then measure the share of new users who hit it.

## Checklist
- Write the activation event in one line (action + outcome).
- Measure time-to-activation by cohort and segment.
- Separate product activation from sales-assisted activation.
- Identify the top three steps blocking activation.
- Align trial length with average activation time.
- Add in-product prompts that drive the activation event.
- Track activation rate by acquisition channel.
- Review activation definition quarterly as features evolve.
