## Definition
Activation is the moment a user reaches a first meaningful outcome that signals product value.
## Why it matters
Activation is a leading indicator of retention and upgrade intent, and it shapes trial and onboarding design.
## Pricing implications
If activation is slow, longer trials or guided setup may outperform discounts. If it is fast, earlier upgrades can work.
## Measurement tips
Define one primary activation event, then measure activation rate and time-to-activation by cohort.
## Checklist
- Write the activation event in one sentence.
- Measure time-to-activation by cohort and segment.
- Separate product-led and sales-led activation.
- Identify the top steps blocking activation.
- Align trial length with average activation time.
- Add prompts that drive the activation event.
- Track activation by acquisition channel.
- Review the definition quarterly.
## Examples
- First project created and shared with a teammate.
