## Definition
Backups are data copies stored for recovery and disaster protection, adding storage and retrieval costs.

## Why it matters
Backups can materially increase storage costs, especially with long retention periods. Pricing needs to include this
overhead to avoid margin erosion.

## Pricing implications
If backups are included, bake the cost into GB-month pricing. If optional, price backups as an add-on or premium tier.

## Measurement tips
Track backup storage volume and retrieval frequency to estimate true cost impact.

## Checklist
- Include backup storage in GB-month cost assumptions.
- Account for retention period length.
- Include retrieval request costs if frequent.
- Separate backup costs if offered as an add-on.
- Update backup costs when storage pricing changes.
- Avoid hiding backup costs in fixed overhead.
- Validate backup costs with billing data.
- Document backup policies in pricing assumptions.
