## Definition
An annual prepay discount reduces price when a customer pays a full year upfront, improving cash flow and reducing churn risk.
## Why it matters
Done well, it stabilizes revenue and aligns incentives. Done poorly, it locks in low pricing and erodes margin.
## Pricing implications
Compare the discount to the cost of capital, expected churn reduction, and support load. Set a floor to protect gross margin.
## Measurement tips
Track annual conversion rate, renewal rate, and discount-weighted ARPA to confirm the tradeoff is positive.
## Checklist
- Define the list price and the discounted annual price.
- Model the effective monthly rate versus monthly plans.
- Set a maximum discount tied to margin targets.
- Require full upfront payment (no monthly installments).
- Review discounting by segment quarterly.
- Align invoice terms with revenue recognition rules.
- Monitor renewals for annual cohorts.
- Limit discount stacking with promos.
## Examples
-  annual prepay vs  monthly (16.7% discount).
- 10% off annual for SMB, 5% for mid-market.
