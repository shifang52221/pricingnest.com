## Definition
Fair use is a reasonable usage expectation for a plan, designed to prevent abuse and cost spikes.

## Why it matters
Fair use policies protect margins and keep pricing predictable, especially for unlimited or flat-rate plans.

## Pricing implications
If fair use is unclear, customers feel surprised by enforcement. Define thresholds and communicate them upfront.

## Measurement tips
Track users who exceed fair use thresholds and review enforcement outcomes.

## Checklist
- Define fair use limits per plan.
- Publish fair use policy on the pricing page.
- Provide alerts before enforcement.
- Offer upgrades for higher usage.
- Track enforcement impact on churn.
- Avoid vague or hidden fair use rules.
- Review fair use thresholds quarterly.
- Align fair use with cost drivers.
