## Definition
A usage cap is a maximum usage limit that prevents bills from exceeding a set threshold.
## Why it matters
Usage caps reduce bill shock and protect margins from extreme usage spikes.
## Pricing implications
Caps can improve trust but reduce upside revenue. Use them carefully and pair with commitments.
## Measurement tips
Track how often caps are hit and the revenue impact.
## Checklist
- Define cap thresholds per plan.
- Communicate caps clearly on pricing pages.
- Use alerts before caps are reached.
- Offer upgrade paths for higher usage.
- Monitor churn and support tickets after cap events.
- Avoid hidden caps.
- Review cap thresholds quarterly.
- Align caps with cost drivers.
