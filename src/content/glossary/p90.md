## Definition
P90 usage is the 90th percentile usage level: 90% of customers use less, 10% use more.

## Why it matters
P90 is a proxy for heavy usage. It helps you design tiers, overages, and limits that protect margin from power users.

## Pricing implications
If your P90 usage is far above included limits, you need either higher overage rates or a higher base fee to avoid
subsidizing heavy customers.

## Measurement tips
Calculate P90 by plan or segment to avoid mixing different usage profiles.

## Checklist
- Calculate P90 by plan and cohort.
- Compare P90 to P50 to understand usage skew.
- Use P90 to set tier breakpoints or overage rates.
- Recompute after major feature launches.
- Validate P90 with actual billing data.
- Keep the time window consistent (monthly is common).
- Avoid mixing free and paid users.
- Track P90 shifts after pricing changes.
