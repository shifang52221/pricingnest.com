## Definition
Egress is outbound data transfer from your infrastructure to the public internet or customer networks.
## Why it matters
Egress costs can spike with heavy users, streaming, or cache misses and are easy to underprice.
## Pricing implications
Set included bandwidth with clear overages, and use tiers that reflect lower unit costs at scale.
## Common drivers
Large downloads, API responses, video streaming, and cache misses from origin fetch.
## Measurement tips
Track egress by product area and region to identify high-cost segments.
## Checklist
- Define what counts as billable egress.
- Include egress in cost of goods sold.
- Set tiered rates for high-volume customers.
- Monitor cache hit rates to control egress.
- Review vendor egress pricing quarterly.
- Surface usage in customer dashboards.
- Add alerts for sudden spikes.
- Align overage pricing with margins.
