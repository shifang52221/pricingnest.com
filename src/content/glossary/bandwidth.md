## Definition
Bandwidth is the amount of data transferred over a network in a given time period, commonly measured and billed per GB.
## Why it matters
High data transfer can drive material infrastructure costs and can quickly erode margins if not priced or controlled.
## Pricing implications
Separate storage from bandwidth in plans, use usage tiers to reflect marginal costs, and add overage rates for spikes.
## Common drivers
Large file downloads, streaming, API responses, and CDN cache misses are typical bandwidth drivers.
## Measurement tips
Track bandwidth by product area, customer segment, and region to identify the highest cost contributors.
## Checklist
- Define what counts as billable transfer.
- Decide on included bandwidth per plan.
- Set tiered rates for overages.
- Monitor cache hit rates and origin fetch usage.
- Review bandwidth costs quarterly.
- Surface bandwidth usage in customer dashboards.
- Align rate cards with vendor costs.
- Document bandwidth assumptions in pricing models.
## Examples
- 2 TB included per month, then $0.08 per GB.
- Tiered rates: 0 to 10 TB, 10 to 50 TB, 50 TB+.
