## Definition
Marginal cost is the incremental cost to serve one more unit or customer.

## Why it matters
Marginal cost drives unit economics and sets the floor for usage-based pricing.

## Pricing implications
If price per unit is below marginal cost, margins erode as usage grows. Use marginal cost to set overage rates.

## Measurement tips
Use blended unit costs from billing data and update regularly.

## Checklist
- Calculate marginal cost per unit.
- Separate marginal cost from fixed overhead.
- Use marginal cost in tiered pricing models.
- Validate marginal cost against invoices.
- Update marginal cost after vendor changes.
- Model p50 and p90 usage scenarios.
- Avoid using list prices as marginal cost.
- Document assumptions for finance alignment.
