## Definition
Revenue recognition is the accounting process of recording revenue over time as services are delivered.

## Why it matters
Recognized revenue often differs from cash collected and ARR run-rate metrics. Mixing these can cause incorrect pricing
and forecasting decisions.

## Pricing implications
Pricing changes can affect bookings quickly, but recognized revenue lags. Use recognized revenue for finance reporting
and ARR for operational decisions.

## Measurement tips
Align revenue recognition policies with contract terms and delivery schedules.

## Checklist
- Separate cash collected, bookings, and recognized revenue.
- Use consistent recognition rules across contracts.
- Normalize annual contracts into monthly recognized revenue.
- Avoid mixing revenue recognition with ARR reporting.
- Reconcile recognition with billing data regularly.
- Track deferred revenue if prepay is common.
- Document revenue recognition policies clearly.
- Coordinate changes with finance.
