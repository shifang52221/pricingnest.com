## Definition
Tiers are pricing levels that bundle features or usage limits to segment customers.
## Why it matters
Tiers guide upgrades and align pricing with value. Poor tiering causes bill shock or underpricing.
## Pricing implications
Use tier breakpoints based on usage distribution (p50, p75, p90) and value differentiation.
## Measurement tips
Track upgrade, downgrade, and churn rates by tier.
## Checklist
- Define clear tier differentiation.
- Use usage data to set tier breakpoints.
- Publish example bills per tier.
- Avoid too many tiers without clear value.
- Track migration between tiers.
- Review tiers after pricing changes.
- Align tiers with sales packaging.
- Update tiers quarterly.
