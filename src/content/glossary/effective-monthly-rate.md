## Definition
Effective monthly rate is the annual price normalized to a monthly equivalent.

## Why it matters
It helps customers compare monthly and annual plans and reduces confusion about discounts.

## Pricing implications
If the effective monthly rate is too low, you may be over-discounting annual plans.

## Measurement tips
Show the effective monthly rate on pricing pages and renewal notices.

## Checklist
- Calculate effective monthly rate for all annual plans.
- Show effective rate alongside annual price.
- Compare effective rates across segments.
- Use effective rates in discount analysis.
- Update effective rates when list prices change.
- Avoid hiding effective rates from buyers.
- Track churn differences by effective rate.
- Validate calculations with finance.
