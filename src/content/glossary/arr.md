## Definition
ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) is the annualized run rate of recurring revenue, typically MRR x 12.

## Why it matters
ARR is a standard SaaS metric for comparing growth over time, but it is not recognized revenue.

## Pricing implications
Price changes can shift ARR quickly, but you must validate against churn and retention to confirm sustainable impact.

## Measurement tips
Use normalized MRR and exclude one-time fees.

## Checklist
- Use consistent MRR definitions.
- Exclude non-recurring services from ARR.
- Normalize annual contracts to monthly equivalents.
- Compare ARR trends by segment.
- Avoid mixing ARR with recognized revenue.
- Recompute ARR after pricing changes.
- Track ARR alongside churn metrics.
- Document ARR calculation methods.
