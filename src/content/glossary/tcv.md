## Definition
TCV (Total Contract Value) is the total value of a contract over its full term, including multi-year commitments.

## Why it matters
TCV is useful for sales reporting, but it can overstate short-term performance compared to ARR or revenue recognition.

## Pricing implications
Large discounts or concessions inflate TCV less than they impact margin. Use TCV alongside ARR to avoid misleading
conclusions.

## Measurement tips
Track TCV by segment and contract length to understand deal quality.

## Checklist
- Include the full contract term in TCV.
- Separate recurring and non-recurring components.
- Compare TCV to ARR for operational planning.
- Track TCV by segment and channel.
- Avoid mixing TCV with recognized revenue.
- Document discounting in TCV assumptions.
- Normalize TCV for multi-year comparisons.
- Use TCV for sales forecasting, not churn analysis.
