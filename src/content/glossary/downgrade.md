## Definition
A downgrade is a reduction in recurring revenue from a customer due to moving to a lower plan or reduced usage.

## Why it matters
Downgrades reduce gross revenue retention and can signal pricing or value misalignment.

## Pricing implications
If downgrades increase after a price change, you may need clearer value messaging or better tier boundaries.

## Measurement tips
Track downgrades by plan, cohort, and segment to identify where revenue leakage occurs.

## Checklist
- Separate downgrades from churn in retention reporting.
- Track downgrade reasons (pricing, usage, product gaps).
- Monitor downgrade rates after pricing changes.
- Compare downgrades across plans.
- Use downgrade trends to adjust tier definitions.
- Avoid mixing downgrades with contractions from usage drops.
- Validate downgrade data against billing events.
- Review downgrades quarterly with product and finance.
