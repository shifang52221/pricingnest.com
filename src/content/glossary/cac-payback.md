## Definition
CAC payback period is the number of months of gross profit needed to recover customer acquisition cost.
## Why it matters
It links pricing, margin, and sales efficiency, helping you decide how much to invest in growth.
## Pricing implications
Higher margins and higher ARPA shorten payback and allow more aggressive acquisition spending.
## Measurement tips
Use gross profit, not revenue, and exclude one-time fees unless they are recurring and predictable.
## Checklist
- Use fully loaded CAC (sales + marketing).
- Use gross profit, not top-line revenue.
- Separate payback by segment and channel.
- Account for ramp time to full usage.
- Monitor payback after pricing changes.
- Set target payback ranges by market.
- Validate against cohort retention.
- Document all assumptions.
## Examples
- ,800 CAC /  monthly gross profit = 12 months payback.
