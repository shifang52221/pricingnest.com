## Definition
A discount is a price reduction used to drive conversion, retention, or commitment.

## Why it matters
Discounts can grow revenue and reduce churn, but they also reduce margin and can reset customer expectations.

## Pricing implications
Use discounts intentionally and track their impact on LTV and payback. Avoid blanket discounts without segmentation.

## Measurement tips
Track discount rates by segment and sales channel.

## Checklist
- Define who is eligible for discounts.
- Set discount limits and approvals.
- Track discount impact on margin and churn.
- Avoid stacking multiple discounts without approval.
- Use discounts to drive commitment, not to mask value gaps.
- Compare discounted vs list price conversion.
- Re-evaluate discount strategy quarterly.
- Keep discount terms clear in contracts.
