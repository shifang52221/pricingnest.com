## Definition
Support costs are the people, tools, and processes required to assist customers (tickets, onboarding, success, on-call).

## Why it matters
Support costs can be a meaningful part of COGS, especially for enterprise or complex products. If you ignore them,
gross margin and payback targets will look better than reality.

## Pricing implications
If support scales with customer count, include a per-account allocation in fixed overhead. If support scales with usage,
include a per-unit component or premium support tier.

## Measurement tips
Track support hours per account and cost per ticket by plan to identify subsidized segments.

## Checklist
- Define what counts as support (tickets, onboarding, success, on-call).
- Separate fixed support overhead from variable support per account.
- Allocate support costs by plan or segment.
- Include premium support as an add-on if it is costly.
- Track ticket volume and resolution time by cohort.
- Update support costs quarterly as staffing changes.
- Avoid mixing sales and support costs in COGS.
- Use support costs in CAC payback and LTV models.
