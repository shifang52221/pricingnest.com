## Definition
ACV (Annual Contract Value) is the annualized value of a contract, commonly used in enterprise sales reporting.

## Why it matters
ACV helps compare deal size across contracts of different lengths, but it is not the same as ARR or recognized revenue.

## Pricing implications
Discounts and concessions reduce ACV and margins. Use ACV alongside retention metrics to avoid overstating health.

## Measurement tips
Normalize multi-year contracts by dividing total contract value by the number of years.

## Checklist
- Define ACV consistently across teams.
- Separate ACV from ARR and bookings.
- Track ACV by segment and sales channel.
- Exclude one-time fees from ACV.
- Reconcile ACV with contract data.
- Use ACV for sales performance, not churn analysis.
- Document discount policies in ACV reporting.
- Compare ACV trends quarter over quarter.
