## Definition
Usage forecast is a projection of customer usage over time, used to design tiers, commitments, and pricing guardrails.

## Why it matters
Forecasts help you size included usage and predict cost exposure. Without a forecast, tier design becomes guesswork.

## Pricing implications
If forecasts show heavy usage growth, you need tiered pricing or minimums to protect margins. If growth is modest, you can
keep pricing simple.

## Measurement tips
Use cohort data and recent usage trends, then model p50 and p90 scenarios.

## Checklist
- Use cohort-based usage trends.
- Model p50 and p90 usage scenarios.
- Separate base usage from seasonal spikes.
- Update forecasts quarterly.
- Validate forecasts with actual billing data.
- Use forecasts to set tier breakpoints.
- Document forecast assumptions.
- Tie forecast ranges to pricing decisions.
