## Definition
The billing cycle is how often you invoice customers (monthly, quarterly, annual).

## Why it matters
Billing cycle affects cash flow, churn measurement, and how customers perceive price changes.

## Pricing implications
Annual billing often reduces churn but can hide early dissatisfaction. Monthly billing provides faster feedback but can
increase churn sensitivity.

## Measurement tips
Track churn and renewal rates separately for monthly vs annual customers.

## Checklist
- Define billing cycles clearly in contracts.
- Align billing cycle with payment terms and renewals.
- Separate churn metrics by billing cycle.
- Model cash flow differences between cycles.
- Communicate changes well ahead of renewal.
- Use cohorts to compare retention by cycle.
- Avoid mixing monthly and annual MRR in reports.
- Review billing cycle strategy quarterly.
