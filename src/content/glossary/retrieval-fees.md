## Definition
Retrieval fees are charges for reading data from cold or archival storage tiers.

## Why it matters
Retrieval fees can surprise customers and create margin risk if you price storage without them.

## Pricing implications
If retrieval is common, include fees in pricing or provide an add-on. If retrieval is rare, document it clearly.

## Measurement tips
Track retrieval frequency and volume by tier.

## Checklist
- Include retrieval fees in cost models.
- Document retrieval pricing on the pricing page.
- Offer clear expectations for retrieval latency.
- Track retrieval usage by customer segment.
- Avoid hiding retrieval fees in fine print.
- Update retrieval fees when vendor pricing changes.
- Provide alerts before large retrieval charges.
- Review retrieval policies quarterly.
