## Definition
A pricing metric is the unit you charge on, such as seats, requests, or GB-month.

## Why it matters
The pricing metric determines how buyers perceive value and how revenue scales with usage.

## Pricing implications
If the metric aligns with value, customers accept higher prices. If it aligns only with cost, growth can be limited.

## Measurement tips
Compare usage trends with willingness to pay to validate the metric choice.

## Checklist
- Define the metric in plain language.
- Ensure the metric aligns with value delivery.
- Keep metric definitions consistent across plans.
- Publish examples to help buyers estimate spend.
- Avoid overly complex metrics that reduce trust.
- Re-evaluate the metric after major product changes.
- Validate with customer feedback.
- Track conversion and churn after metric changes.
