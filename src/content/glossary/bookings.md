## Definition
Bookings are contracted revenue amounts signed in agreements, often for annual or multi-year terms.

## Why it matters
Bookings can lead recognized revenue and ARR, so mixing them can overstate operational performance.

## Pricing implications
Price changes can boost bookings quickly, but you should compare bookings to churn and retention before declaring success.

## Measurement tips
Track bookings by segment and contract length to understand sales performance.

## Checklist
- Separate bookings from recognized revenue.
- Normalize bookings to ARR for comparisons.
- Track bookings by plan and segment.
- Account for discounts and concessions.
- Avoid counting non-recurring services as bookings.
- Reconcile bookings with billing systems.
- Use a consistent period (monthly or quarterly).
- Review booking trends alongside churn.
