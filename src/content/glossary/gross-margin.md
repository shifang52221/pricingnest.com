## Definition
Gross margin is the percentage of revenue remaining after cost of goods sold (COGS).
## Why it matters
It sets the floor for discounts, the ceiling for acquisition spend, and the guardrails for pricing experiments.
## Pricing implications
Price floors should protect target gross margin after discounts, refunds, and usage variability.
## Measurement tips
Use blended costs, include support and infrastructure if they scale with usage, and track margin by segment.
## Checklist
- Define what is included in COGS.
- Track gross margin by plan and segment.
- Model margin under p90 usage.
- Include discounts and credits in revenue.
- Review margin after vendor price changes.
- Align pricing tiers with cost tiers.
- Avoid discounts that break margin floors.
- Document margin targets and assumptions.
