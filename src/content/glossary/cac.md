## Definition
CAC is the total sales and marketing cost required to acquire a new customer over a defined period.
## Why it matters
CAC determines how much you can spend to grow while staying within margin and payback targets.
## Pricing implications
Higher ARPA and stronger gross margin reduce payback time and allow higher CAC.
## Measurement tips
Use fully loaded sales and marketing costs, and measure CAC by channel and segment.
## Checklist
- Define the time window for CAC.
- Include all sales and marketing expenses.
- Separate CAC by channel and segment.
- Compare CAC to LTV and payback targets.
- Track CAC trend after pricing changes.
- Validate CAC with cohort retention data.
- Exclude one-off anomalies from the model.
- Document assumptions and formulas.
