## Definition
A minimum commitment is a minimum monthly or annual spend requirement, often paired with usage pricing.

## Why it matters
Minimum commitments protect margin and ensure predictable revenue, especially for usage-heavy products.

## Pricing implications
If commitments are too high, conversion drops. If too low, heavy users can become unprofitable. Use cohort data to set
the right floor.

## Measurement tips
Track conversion rate and churn for plans with commitments.

## Checklist
- Set commitments based on typical usage and cost recovery.
- Align commitments with contract length and segment.
- Publish commitments clearly on the pricing page.
- Offer ramp periods for new customers when needed.
- Track churn after commitment changes.
- Avoid hidden commitment terms.
- Align commitments with sales incentives.
- Review commitments quarterly.
