## Definition
A rate card is a structured list of unit prices for usage, add-ons, and services used in quoting and contracts.

## Why it matters
Rate cards keep pricing consistent across sales, renewals, and expansions. They reduce ad-hoc discounting and confusion.

## Pricing implications
If your rate card is too complex, deals slow down. If it is too simple, you may underprice high-cost usage. Keep it
aligned with your cost drivers and margin targets.

## Measurement tips
Track discount rates and deviations from the rate card to identify pricing leakage.

## Checklist
- Define unit names and billing cadence clearly.
- Include minimum fees or commitments where needed.
- Align rate card prices with your margin targets.
- Update rate cards after vendor cost changes.
- Keep a single source of truth for sales and finance.
- Document approved discount ranges.
- Use the same units across contracts and invoices.
- Review rate cards quarterly.
