## Definition
Packaging is the structure of plans, limits, and feature bundles that customers can buy.
## Why it matters
Great packaging makes value obvious, reduces choice overload, and aligns upgrades with customer growth.
## Pricing implications
Packaging often moves revenue more than price changes. Poor bundles can push high-value users into low tiers.
## Signals to watch
High downgrade rates, plan confusion tickets, and low conversion to higher tiers.
## Design principles
Bundle around outcomes, separate by usage or team size, and make upgrade paths clear.
## Checklist
- Define the target segment for each plan.
- Tie plan names to outcomes, not features.
- Use limits to separate tiers when features overlap.
- Keep core plans to three unless there is strong justification.
- Add a mid-tier that captures the most common use case.
- Track plan migration patterns quarterly.
- Validate packaging with sales and support feedback.
- Document the rationale for each tier.
## Examples
- Starter for individuals, Team for collaboration, Scale for high usage.
