## Definition
Packaging is the structure of plans, limits, and feature bundles that customers can buy.

## Why it matters
Good packaging makes value obvious and reduces choice overload. It also determines how revenue scales with customer
growth.

## Pricing implications
Packaging can be a bigger lever than the price itself. The wrong bundle can push high-value customers into low plans or
force small teams to overbuy.

## Signals to watch
Look for high downgrade rates, support tickets about plan confusion, and low attach rates to higher tiers.

## Checklist
- Define which customer segments each plan serves.
- Bundle around outcomes, not just feature lists.
- Use limits to separate tiers when features are similar.
- Keep plan names consistent with the value delivered.
- Test a mid-tier that captures the most common use case.
- Avoid more than three core plans without a clear reason.
- Track plan migration patterns quarterly.
- Document why each feature lives in its current tier.
