## Definition
ARPU is average revenue per user, typically used in consumer or seat-based products.

## Why it matters
ARPU helps you track monetization efficiency. It differs from ARPA (per account) and can shift with pricing or usage.

## Pricing implications
If ARPU is flat while usage grows, pricing may not be capturing value. Use ARPU trends to adjust tiers or add-ons.

## Measurement tips
Use consistent time windows and exclude one-time fees for a stable ARPU trend.

## Checklist
- Define whether ARPU includes usage revenue.
- Use a consistent time window (monthly or quarterly).
- Separate paid and free users when calculating ARPU.
- Track ARPU by plan or cohort.
- Compare ARPU before and after pricing changes.
- Avoid mixing ARPU with ARPA in reports.
- Normalize annual contracts to monthly revenue.
- Use ARPU trends to guide packaging decisions.
