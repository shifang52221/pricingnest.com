## Definition
Variable cost is a cost that scales with usage, such as calls, GB-month, or minutes.

## Why it matters
Variable costs determine unit economics and margin. If they are underestimated, pricing will not cover cost at scale.

## Pricing implications
Usage-based pricing should align with variable costs. If variable costs rise with usage spikes, overage rates should
reflect that risk.

## Measurement tips
Use blended unit costs from billing data and update them regularly.

## Checklist
- Separate variable costs from fixed overhead.
- Track variable cost per unit over time.
- Include vendor pass-through costs.
- Model p50 and p90 usage scenarios.
- Update costs after vendor pricing changes.
- Use variable cost in margin and payback models.
- Validate against invoices quarterly.
- Document cost assumptions in pricing reviews.
