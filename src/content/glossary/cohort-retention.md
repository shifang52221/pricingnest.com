## Definition
Cohort retention measures retention for a specific cohort over time, such as customers who started in the same month.

## Why it matters
Cohort retention shows whether retention is improving or worsening for newer cohorts, independent of base growth.

## Pricing implications
Pricing or packaging changes can improve cohort retention even if overall churn looks flat. Cohort retention reveals
those changes early.

## Measurement tips
Plot retention curves by cohort month and segment.

## Checklist
- Define cohorts by start month or plan.
- Track retention by cohort age (month 1, month 2, month 3).
- Separate logo and revenue retention.
- Compare cohorts before and after pricing changes.
- Avoid mixing trial and paid cohorts.
- Use consistent retention definitions.
- Identify cohorts with sharp early drops.
- Share cohort retention with product and finance.
