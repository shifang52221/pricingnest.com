## Definition
ARRR is a lifecycle framework that tracks users through acquisition, activation, retention, revenue, and referral.
## Why it matters
It makes pricing tradeoffs visible by showing how changes shift conversion between stages.
## Pricing implications
If activation is weak, packaging and trial length matter more than price. If retention is weak, value-based tiers help.
## Measurement tips
Use consistent time windows and define one primary metric for each stage to avoid metric sprawl.
## Checklist
- Define each stage in one sentence.
- Track conversion rates between stages by cohort.
- Separate new, expansion, and churned revenue.
- Monitor referral sources separately.
- Tie experiments to one stage movement.
- Review stage definitions quarterly.
- Keep activation and retention metrics aligned.
- Align ownership for each stage.
