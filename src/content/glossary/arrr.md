## Definition
ARRR is a funnel-style framework that tracks users from acquisition to activation, retention, revenue, and referral.

## Why it matters
Pricing decisions show up as movement between the stages. A discount might improve acquisition but hurt retention, while
feature gating can lift revenue yet slow activation. The framework keeps tradeoffs visible.

## Pricing implications
Use ARRR to decide which levers to test first. If activation is weak, packaging and trial length matter more than price
points. If retention is weak, usage-based billing and value-based tiers often outperform flat discounts.

## Data to track
Track a single definition for each stage, then measure the conversion rate between each step by cohort.

## Checklist
- Define the activation event in one sentence (what action signals first value).
- Separate trial users from paying users to avoid mixing stage definitions.
- Track retention by cohort month, not just account age.
- Split revenue into new, expansion, contraction, and churn.
- Monitor referral sources separately from paid acquisition.
- Use consistent time windows (weekly or monthly) across all stages.
- Flag one metric per stage as the owner KPI to avoid metric sprawl.
- Tie experiment goals to a specific stage movement (e.g., activation rate).
