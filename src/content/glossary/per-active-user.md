## Definition
Per active user pricing charges based on active users rather than total seats.

## Why it matters
It aligns pricing with actual usage and reduces friction for teams with many inactive seats.

## Pricing implications
If activation is low, per active user pricing can reduce revenue. Use minimums or base fees to protect margins.

## Measurement tips
Define what counts as active (login, action, or usage threshold).

## Checklist
- Define the active user threshold clearly.
- Track active vs total seats by plan.
- Use minimum fees to recover fixed costs.
- Publish active user definitions on the pricing page.
- Monitor revenue impact vs seat pricing.
- Avoid ambiguous activity windows.
- Review active thresholds quarterly.
- Align metrics with billing systems.
