## Definition
A retention curve is a chart of retention over time, showing how many customers stay active by cohort age.

## Why it matters
Retention curves reveal whether churn happens early or later. They help you see if pricing changes improve long-term
stickiness.

## Pricing implications
If the curve drops sharply early, your entry pricing or onboarding may be misaligned. If it flattens later, premium
tiers or add-ons may be working.

## Measurement tips
Plot retention by cohort month and by plan to detect segment-specific issues.

## Checklist
- Use consistent time windows (weekly or monthly).
- Separate logo and revenue retention curves.
- Compare cohorts before and after pricing changes.
- Look for early drops vs long tails.
- Segment by plan and channel.
- Use the curve to validate activation improvements.
- Track retention at key milestones (month 1, month 3, month 6).
- Share curves with product and finance.
