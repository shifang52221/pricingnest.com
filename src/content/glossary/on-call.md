## Definition
On-call is the rotating coverage model used to respond to incidents outside normal business hours.

## Why it matters
On-call coverage is expensive and influences what service levels you can promise. It is often the hidden cost behind
premium support tiers or enterprise plans.

## Pricing implications
If on-call demand is frequent, you need either higher base pricing or a paid support add-on. If demand is rare, you can
offer on-call as an optional SLA upgrade.

## Operational signals
Track incident volume, after-hours pages, and average response time. These inputs determine the staffing load and the
true cost of 24/7 coverage.

## Checklist
- Define what qualifies as an on-call incident versus normal support.
- Map on-call coverage to SLA language in your plans.
- Estimate the per-incident cost (engineer time + escalation).
- Separate premium support pricing from core product pricing.
- Document response time expectations to avoid ambiguity.
- Track on-call load by tier to spot subsidized customers.
- Re-evaluate staffing needs after major releases or growth spikes.
- Include a downgrade path if customers no longer need 24/7 support.
