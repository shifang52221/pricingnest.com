## Definition
On-call is the rotating coverage used to respond to incidents outside normal business hours.
## Why it matters
On-call coverage is expensive and often the hidden cost behind premium support tiers and uptime guarantees.
## Pricing implications
Frequent on-call demand requires higher base pricing or a paid support add-on. Rare demand can be sold as an upgrade.
## Operational signals
Track incident volume, after-hours pages, and response times to estimate staffing load.
## Measurement tips
Calculate cost per incident and total on-call hours by tier to avoid subsidizing heavy users.
## Checklist
- Define what counts as an on-call incident.
- Map on-call coverage to SLA language.
- Estimate per-incident cost including escalation.
- Separate support pricing from core product pricing.
- Track on-call load by plan.
- Re-evaluate staffing after major releases.
- Align alerting to reduce false pages.
- Offer downgrade paths when 24/7 coverage is no longer needed.
