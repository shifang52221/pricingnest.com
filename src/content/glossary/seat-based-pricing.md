## Definition
Seat-based pricing charges customers based on the number of users or seats provisioned.
## Why it matters
It is easy to explain and forecast, but can misalign value when usage intensity drives cost.
## Pricing implications
Use active seat definitions, minimum seat commitments, and overage pricing to prevent misuse.
## Measurement tips
Track seats provisioned vs active, and monitor cost per active seat to protect margin.
## Checklist
- Define what counts as a billable seat.
- Decide on active vs provisioned billing.
- Set minimum seat commitments.
- Provide seat tiers with volume discounts.
- Add overage pricing for seat spikes.
- Monitor seat utilization trends.
- Avoid incentives to create unused seats.
- Align seat limits with plan value.
