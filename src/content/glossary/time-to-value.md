## Definition
Time to value (TTV) is the elapsed time from signup to the first meaningful outcome.

## Why it matters
Long TTV increases churn risk and reduces willingness to pay. Short TTV allows faster expansion and smoother upgrades.

## Pricing implications
When TTV is long, customers need more onboarding and may prefer slower pricing ramps. When TTV is short, you can push
value-based pricing earlier in the lifecycle.

## Measurement tips
Measure TTV by segment, because enterprise customers may have long onboarding while self-serve users should be fast.

## Checklist
- Define the value event you want to measure.
- Track median TTV by cohort and segment.
- Identify steps that contribute most to delay.
- Offer templates or guided setup to shrink TTV.
- Align trial length with TTV plus a small buffer.
- Keep early pricing simple to avoid friction.
- Compare TTV for customers who churn vs. retain.
- Review TTV after major product changes.
