## Definition
Time to value (TTV) is the elapsed time from signup to the first meaningful outcome that confirms product value.
## Why it matters
Shorter TTV increases retention, upsell readiness, and willingness to pay. Longer TTV increases churn risk and sales friction.
## Pricing implications
If TTV is long, use longer trials, guided onboarding, or phased ramp pricing. If TTV is short, upgrades can happen earlier.
## Measurement tips
Track median and p90 TTV by segment, and separate self-serve from sales-led cohorts.
## Checklist
- Define the activation event in one line.
- Measure TTV by plan, segment, and channel.
- Identify the biggest step delays in the activation path.
- Align trial length with median TTV plus a buffer.
- Add templates or walkthroughs to shrink TTV.
- Compare TTV for churned vs retained cohorts.
- Recompute TTV after major product changes.
- Document the TTV definition and owners.
## Examples
- TTV = time from signup to first dashboard shared with a teammate.
