## Definition
An add-on is a paid feature, capacity block, or service that can be purchased on top of a base plan.

## Why it matters
Add-ons let you monetize edge cases without overpricing the core plan. They are also a clean way to recover variable
costs like storage, support, or premium data sources.

## Pricing implications
Add-ons work best when the value is clear and usage is uneven. If only 20% of customers need a feature, an add-on can
protect price sensitivity while still capturing willingness to pay.

## Common pitfalls
- Bundling an add-on that most customers require (creates hidden base price increases).
- Pricing an add-on below the cost it is meant to recover.
- Allowing add-ons to replace the base plan instead of complementing it.

## Checklist
- State the add-on outcome in plain language, not just the feature name.
- Set a usage guardrail so the add-on covers variable costs.
- Require the base plan to avoid cannibalization.
- Include limits, not just prices, in the add-on description.
- Provide one example of when to buy it and when not to.
- Align billing cadence with the base plan to reduce invoice friction.
- Track attach rate by cohort to validate demand.
- Review the add-on after 90 days to adjust price or packaging.
