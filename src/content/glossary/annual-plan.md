## Definition
An annual plan is a subscription billed yearly, often with a discount or prepay incentive.

## Why it matters
Annual plans improve cash flow and reduce churn risk, but they change revenue recognition timing.

## Pricing implications
Annual discounts should be balanced against margin and churn benefits. Over-discounting can reduce LTV.

## Measurement tips
Track annual vs monthly renewal rates and effective monthly price.

## Checklist
- Set a clear annual discount policy.
- Show effective monthly rate on the pricing page.
- Model cash flow benefits vs discount cost.
- Separate annual plans in retention analysis.
- Avoid mixing annual revenue with MRR.
- Document renewal terms and notice periods.
- Use cohorts to track annual plan retention.
- Update annual pricing when list prices change.
