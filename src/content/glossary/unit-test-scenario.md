## Definition
Scenario modeling is the practice of testing best, base, and worst cases (often p50 vs p90 usage) to stress-test pricing.

## Why it matters
Pricing models break when usage spikes or costs rise. Scenario modeling helps you see margin risk before it hits the P&L.

## Pricing implications
Use scenarios to set tier breakpoints, minimum fees, or overage rates that protect margin at high usage.

## Measurement tips
Pick a base scenario that matches your typical customer and a high scenario that matches your heavy users.

## Checklist
- Define p50 and p90 usage inputs.
- Include fixed overhead in every scenario.
- Compare gross margin across scenarios.
- Test at least one downside cost scenario.
- Use scenarios to set tier thresholds.
- Document assumptions for each scenario.
- Re-run scenarios after pricing changes.
- Share scenario results with finance and product.
