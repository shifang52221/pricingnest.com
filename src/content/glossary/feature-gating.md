## Definition
Feature gating means limiting specific features to higher tiers or add-ons.

## Why it matters
Gating helps differentiate plans without forcing usage-based pricing. It can raise willingness to pay when features map
to clear business outcomes.

## Pricing implications
The strongest gates protect high-value workflows, not minor convenience features. If the gate is too weak, customers
upgrade for a month and then downgrade.

## Design considerations
Pair gates with usage limits so customers have a path to upgrade. Overly hard gates can slow activation and reduce trial
conversion.

## Checklist
- Tie each gated feature to a measurable business outcome.
- Avoid gating features required for basic success.
- Limit the number of gates per tier to keep plans legible.
- Add preview access so users can see the feature before paying.
- Offer a usage-based alternative if gating blocks core workflows.
- Track upgrade rate and downgrade rate after adding a gate.
- Document the rationale for each gate for internal alignment.
- Review gates after major feature launches.
