## Definition
Feature gating limits specific features to higher tiers or add-ons instead of charging purely on usage.
## Why it matters
Gating differentiates plans and captures willingness to pay when features map to clear business outcomes.
## Pricing implications
Strong gates protect high-value workflows. Weak gates create churn or short-term upgrades with quick downgrades.
## Design guidelines
Gate outcomes, not minor conveniences, and pair with usage limits or upgrade paths.
## Measurement tips
Track upgrade rate, downgrade rate, and activation impact after introducing a gate.
## Checklist
- Tie each gated feature to a measurable outcome.
- Avoid gating features required for basic success.
- Limit the number of gates per tier for clarity.
- Offer previews so users can see gated value.
- Provide usage-based alternatives when possible.
- Monitor activation and conversion impact.
- Document the rationale for each gate.
- Review gates after major launches.
