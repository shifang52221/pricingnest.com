## Definition
An API call is a request to an API endpoint, often priced per call or per 1,000 calls.

## Why it matters
API calls are a common pricing unit. Clear definitions reduce billing disputes and help buyers estimate spend.

## Pricing implications
If API calls drive cost, use per-call or per-1,000 pricing with a base fee. Use tiered overages to protect margins at
high volumes.

## Measurement tips
Use blended infra and vendor costs to estimate unit cost per call.

## Checklist
- Define what counts as a billable call.
- Keep the unit consistent across pricing and invoices.
- Model p50 and p90 call volumes.
- Use a base fee for fixed overhead.
- Publish example bills for typical usage.
- Track call volume by plan.
- Re-evaluate pricing after traffic growth.
- Avoid ambiguous units customers cannot estimate.
