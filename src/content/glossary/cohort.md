## Definition
A cohort is a group of customers or users that share a common start date or attribute.

## Why it matters
Cohorts reveal trends hidden in averages, such as improving retention after a packaging change or declining usage after a
price increase.

## Pricing implications
Compare cohorts before and after pricing changes to see if the change improved expansion or worsened churn.

## Common cohort types
Monthly signup cohorts, plan cohorts, and acquisition-channel cohorts are the most actionable for pricing work.

## Checklist
- Choose one cohort definition and keep it consistent.
- Track retention and expansion by cohort month.
- Separate trial cohorts from paid cohorts.
- Use cohort curves to evaluate pricing experiments.
- Highlight cohorts with unusually high churn.
- Compare cohorts across plans to spot mispricing.
- Review cohort health before large price increases.
- Automate cohort reporting to avoid manual errors.
