## Definition
A cohort is a group of users or customers that share a common start date or attribute for analysis.
## Why it matters
Cohort analysis reveals retention and expansion trends that averages can hide.
## Pricing implications
Compare cohorts before and after pricing changes to see if churn or expansion improved.
## Common cohort types
Signup month, first payment month, plan type, and acquisition channel.
## Measurement tips
Keep definitions consistent and separate trial and paid cohorts to avoid mixing behaviors.
## Checklist
- Choose one cohort definition and stick to it.
- Track retention and expansion by cohort month.
- Compare cohorts around pricing changes.
- Highlight cohorts with unusual churn.
- Use cohort curves for experiments.
- Separate free and paid cohorts.
- Automate cohort reporting.
- Review cohort health before price increases.
