## Definition
Payback period is the time required to recover CAC from gross profit.
## Why it matters
Payback shows how quickly you recover acquisition spend and how much cash growth requires.
## Pricing implications
If payback is too long, pricing may need to increase or CAC must decrease.
## Measurement tips
Use contribution margin when variable support costs are significant.
## Checklist
- Calculate payback by segment and channel.
- Use consistent ARPA and margin assumptions.
- Compare payback to cash runway.
- Track payback after pricing changes.
- Separate payback from LTV for clarity.
- Avoid mixing one-time fees into ARPA.
- Review payback targets quarterly.
- Validate payback with finance data.
