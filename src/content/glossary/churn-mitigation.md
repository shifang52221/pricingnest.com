## Definition
Churn mitigation is the set of actions that reduce cancellations and revenue loss across the customer lifecycle.
## Why it matters
Small improvements compound into large ARR gains. Pricing, packaging, and onboarding are frequent root causes.
## Pricing implications
Unexpected overages, sudden price jumps, and unclear limits increase churn. Clear guardrails and ramp pricing help.
## Tactics to combine
Product onboarding, usage alerts, success playbooks, and pricing experiments should be coordinated.
## Measurement tips
Track churn by cohort, plan, and reason, and separate logo churn from revenue churn.
## Checklist
- Track churn by cohort, plan, and acquisition channel.
- Capture cancellation reasons consistently.
- Offer downgrade paths before cancellation.
- Add usage alerts before limits are hit.
- Align contracts with actual usage patterns.
- Review trial to paid activation for early churn.
- Monitor support response time for churn-prone cohorts.
- Revisit packaging and pricing quarterly.
