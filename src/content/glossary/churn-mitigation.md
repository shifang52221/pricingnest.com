## Definition
Churn mitigation is the set of actions that reduce customer cancellations or downgrades.

## Why it matters
Small improvements in churn compound into major ARR gains. Pricing and packaging are often part of the solution, not
just support and onboarding.

## Pricing implications
Pricing shocks and sudden overages drive churn. Transparent limits, clear value messaging, and gradual ramp pricing can
reduce cancellations.

## Levers to consider
Combine product health signals with pricing experiments to identify at-risk cohorts.

## Checklist
- Track churn by cohort, plan, and acquisition channel.
- Identify the top three cancellation reasons and map fixes.
- Offer downgrade paths before cancellation.
- Add usage alerts before customers hit limits.
- Review trial-to-paid activation to prevent early churn.
- Align contracts with actual usage patterns.
- Monitor support response time for churn-prone cohorts.
- Revisit packaging quarterly to remove friction.
