## Definition
The pricing page is the public summary of your plans, units, limits, and pricing rules.

## Why it matters
The pricing page sets expectations and drives conversion. Ambiguity here creates churn, support load, and sales friction.

## Pricing implications
Clear unit definitions and example bills reduce bill shock and improve upgrade confidence. If you sell usage, show
included amounts and overage rates.

## Measurement tips
Track conversion rate, time on page, and support tickets tied to pricing confusion.

## Checklist
- Define units in plain language with examples.
- List included usage and overage rates.
- Show at least one example bill per plan.
- Keep pricing page aligned with contracts and invoices.
- Update promptly when costs or tiers change.
- Avoid hidden fees or unclear limits.
- Include a comparison table for plan differentiation.
- Add FAQs for common objections.
