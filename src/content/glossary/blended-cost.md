## Definition
Blended cost is the weighted average unit cost across regions, tiers, and discounts.

## Why it matters
Blended costs make pricing models realistic. Using a single list price or peak cost can distort margins and payback.

## Pricing implications
If your blended cost is higher than expected, per-unit pricing or margin targets may need adjustment. Blended cost is the
baseline for usage-based pricing and gross margin modeling.

## Measurement tips
Use recent billing data and weight by usage volume across regions and plans.

## Checklist
- Use weighted averages, not simple averages.
- Include discounts and committed-use rates.
- Separate variable and fixed costs.
- Update blended cost monthly or quarterly.
- Document assumptions and data sources.
- Keep unit definitions consistent across models.
- Validate against actual invoices.
- Use blended cost for margin planning and tier design.
