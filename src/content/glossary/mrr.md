## Definition
MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) is normalized monthly revenue from subscriptions.
## Why it matters
MRR is a core SaaS metric for tracking growth and retention, but it is not the same as cash collected.
## Pricing implications
Pricing changes affect MRR quickly. Validate MRR impact against churn and expansion to confirm sustainability.
## Measurement tips
Normalize annual contracts to monthly equivalents and exclude one-time fees.
## Checklist
- Use consistent MRR definitions.
- Exclude one-time fees and services.
- Normalize annual contracts to monthly revenue.
- Track MRR by segment and plan.
- Separate new, expansion, and churned MRR.
- Compare MRR before and after pricing changes.
- Align MRR reporting with finance.
