## Definition
A renewal is when a customer continues their subscription for another term (monthly, annual, or multi-year).

## Why it matters
Renewals protect recurring revenue and determine how much expansion you must generate to grow.

## Pricing implications
Renewal terms, notice periods, and price increase rules can materially affect churn and NRR.

## Measurement tips
Separate renewal rate by plan and billing cycle, then review churn and expansion for each cohort.

## Checklist
- Define renewal terms clearly on contracts and invoices.
- Monitor renewal rates by plan, cohort, and segment.
- Track renewal forecast vs actuals monthly.
- Align price increases with renewal windows.
- Separate renewal churn from logo churn.
- Keep a playbook for renewal outreach and escalation.
