## Definition
Included usage is the amount of usage bundled into a plan or platform fee before overages apply.

## Why it matters
Included usage reduces bill shock and improves conversion. It also determines how quickly customers reach overages.

## Pricing implications
If included usage is too high, you underprice heavy users. If it is too low, customers feel penalized early. Use cohort
data to set the right level.

## Measurement tips
Compare included usage to p50 and p90 usage to calibrate tiers.

## Checklist
- Set included usage based on typical customer usage.
- Align included usage with the base fee value.
- Use tiered overages after included usage.
- Publish example bills showing included usage.
- Re-evaluate included usage after pricing changes.
- Avoid hidden limits that differ from published limits.
- Track overage rates by plan.
- Use included usage to reduce early churn.
