## Definition
Cross-sell is selling a different product or add-on to an existing customer, increasing ARPA.

## Why it matters
Cross-sell expands revenue without acquiring new customers and can improve net revenue retention.

## Pricing implications
Cross-sell works best when add-ons solve a related problem. If cross-sell is low, the add-on value may be unclear or
pricing may be misaligned.

## Measurement tips
Track cross-sell attachment rates by segment and plan.

## Checklist
- Define cross-sell vs upsell clearly.
- Track attachment rates by plan and cohort.
- Identify which add-ons drive the most expansion.
- Monitor cross-sell after pricing changes.
- Avoid counting one-time services as cross-sell.
- Align sales incentives with cross-sell goals.
- Use customer feedback to refine add-ons.
- Validate cross-sell impact on NRR.
