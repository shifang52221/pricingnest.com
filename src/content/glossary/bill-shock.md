## Definition
Bill shock is an unexpectedly high invoice caused by usage-based pricing.

## Why it matters
Bill shock reduces trust, increases churn, and drives support costs. Preventing it improves retention and upsell rates.

## Pricing implications
Use included usage, tiered overages, alerts, and caps to keep bills predictable. If usage is spiky, add guardrails.

## Measurement tips
Track support tickets and churn following large invoices.

## Checklist
- Publish example bills on the pricing page.
- Send alerts before customers exceed thresholds.
- Offer predictable commitments or caps.
- Use tiered pricing for heavy usage.
- Define units clearly and consistently.
- Review invoices for outliers each billing cycle.
- Investigate bill shock as a churn driver.
- Adjust pricing if outliers are frequent.
