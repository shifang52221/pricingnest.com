## Definition
Delaying or rejecting requests when usage exceeds limits; impacts user experience.
## Why it matters
API pricing lives or dies on unit economics. A clear unit and cost model prevents margin surprises.
## Common pitfalls
- Treating vendor/API pass-through costs as zero.
- Using p50 usage only (heavy users can break margins).
- Defining units buyers can’t estimate.
