## Definition
P50 is the median usage level: 50% of customers use less and 50% use more.

## Why it matters
The median is a stable anchor for pricing design. It helps you set included usage and avoid over-optimizing around
outliers.

## Pricing implications
If the P50 user is far below your included limits, you may be giving away value. If the P50 user is above, you may be
forcing upgrades too early.

## Measurement tips
Use a stable period (e.g., trailing three months) and separate cohorts if usage is seasonal.

## Checklist
- Calculate P50 by plan and by cohort.
- Use P50 to set default included limits.
- Compare P50 to P75 and P90 to understand tail risk.
- Recompute after major feature launches.
- Exclude free trials from paid P50 calculations.
- Align P50 limits with the core value metric.
- Validate P50 with revenue impact modeling.
- Revisit pricing if P50 shifts over time.
