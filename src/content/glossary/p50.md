## Definition
P50 is the median usage level where half of customers use less and half use more.
## Why it matters
The median is a stable anchor for pricing design and helps avoid overfitting to heavy users.
## Pricing implications
If P50 is far below included usage, you may be giving away value. If it is above, upgrades may be too early.
## Measurement tips
Use a stable trailing window and segment by plan, region, and customer size.
## Checklist
- Calculate P50 by plan and cohort.
- Compare P50 to P75 and P90.
- Use P50 to set included limits.
- Recompute after major product changes.
- Exclude free trials from paid P50.
- Validate P50 with revenue impact modeling.
- Monitor shifts over time.
- Align P50 limits with the value metric.
