## Definition
Grandfathering means keeping existing customers on old pricing while new customers pay higher prices.

## Why it matters
Grandfathering can reduce churn risk and support load during price increases, but it delays revenue uplift.

## Pricing implications
If you grandfather too long, revenue growth slows. If you do not grandfather at all, churn risk may rise. Balance by
segment and contract term.

## Measurement tips
Track churn and upgrade rates separately for grandfathered vs new pricing cohorts.

## Checklist
- Decide which segments get grandfathered.
- Set a clear end date or upgrade path.
- Communicate changes with advance notice.
- Model revenue impact vs churn risk.
- Track churn and support tickets post-change.
- Avoid multiple legacy price tiers without clear rules.
- Align grandfathering policy with contracts.
- Review the policy after each pricing update.
