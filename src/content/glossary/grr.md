## Definition
GRR (Gross Revenue Retention) is revenue retention excluding expansions. It measures how much revenue you keep after
churn and downgrades only.

## Why it matters
GRR shows product stickiness without upsell effects. It is a core metric for pricing changes that might increase churn.

## Pricing implications
If GRR drops after a price increase, your entry pricing or value messaging may be misaligned. Use GRR to validate
pricing changes before relying on expansion to offset churn.

## Measurement tips
Track GRR by cohort and plan to see which segments are most sensitive to price changes.

## Checklist
- Use a consistent time window (monthly or annual).
- Exclude expansion revenue from GRR.
- Track GRR by plan and segment.
- Compare GRR before and after pricing changes.
- Use GRR alongside NRR for a complete view.
- Keep definitions consistent across finance and product.
- Avoid mixing one-time fees in retention metrics.
- Monitor GRR for early-warning churn signals.
