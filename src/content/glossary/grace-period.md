## Definition
Time window before enforcing limits after payment failure or overage; impacts churn and support.
## Why it matters
Pricing changes are risky without clear definitions and guardrails. This term shows up in rollout decisions.
## Common pitfalls
- Using an ambiguous definition across teams.
- Not writing assumptions down.
- Optimizing for simplicity but losing correctness.
