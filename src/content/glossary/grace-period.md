## Definition
A grace period is the time window before enforcing limits after a payment failure or overage.

## Why it matters
Grace periods reduce churn and support load by giving customers time to fix billing issues or upgrade plans.

## Pricing implications
Long grace periods can increase unpaid usage costs. Short grace periods can increase churn. Balance them by segment.

## Measurement tips
Track recovery rate (customers who resolve issues) and support tickets during the grace window.

## Checklist
- Define grace period length by plan or segment.
- Communicate grace periods clearly in billing emails.
- Monitor unpaid usage during grace windows.
- Set automatic notifications before enforcement.
- Review grace period effectiveness quarterly.
- Align grace periods with payment retry logic.
- Avoid silent enforcement changes.
- Document grace period policies internally.
