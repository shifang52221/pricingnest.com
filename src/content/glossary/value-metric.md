## Definition
A value metric is the unit that best correlates with value delivered to the customer.

## Why it matters
The right value metric increases willingness to pay and reduces pricing friction.

## Pricing implications
If the value metric is unclear, customers struggle to estimate cost. Choose a metric that is easy to understand and
closely tied to outcomes.

## Measurement tips
Validate the metric through customer interviews and usage data.

## Checklist
- Choose a metric tied to customer outcomes.
- Keep the metric easy to estimate.
- Align the metric with cost drivers.
- Use consistent definitions across plans.
- Publish examples on the pricing page.
- Test the metric in experiments before full rollout.
- Monitor churn and conversion after metric changes.
- Revisit the metric as the product evolves.
