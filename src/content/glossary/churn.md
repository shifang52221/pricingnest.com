## Definition
Churn is the rate at which customers or recurring revenue are lost over a period, often measured as logo or revenue churn.
## Why it matters
Small changes in churn have outsized impact on LTV, payback, and growth efficiency.
## Pricing implications
Pricing that misaligns value can increase churn; use renewal pricing and usage caps to protect retention.
## Measurement tips
Use consistent windows, separate cancellations from downgrades, and track cohorts by start month.
## Checklist
- Define logo churn and revenue churn separately.
- Use a standard time window (monthly or annual).
- Separate new, expansion, and contraction components.
- Track churn by segment and plan.
- Measure churn drivers (price, product, support).
- Monitor early-life churn separately.
- Validate churn with cohort analysis.
- Align churn targets with LTV goals.
