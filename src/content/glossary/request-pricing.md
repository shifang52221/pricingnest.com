## Definition
Request pricing charges based on the number of requests, often per 1,000 requests.
## Why it matters
Requests can be a major cost driver for APIs and storage. Clear pricing avoids margin erosion and customer confusion.
## Pricing implications
If request costs are material, include them explicitly in pricing rather than hiding them in base fees.
## Measurement tips
Use blended cost per request and track p50 and p90 request volumes.
## Checklist
- Define what counts as a request.
- Use per-request or per-1,000 pricing for clarity.
- Publish example bills with request volumes.
- Align pricing with request cost drivers.
- Monitor churn after request price changes.
- Avoid ambiguous request units.
- Track request volume by plan.
- Update request costs quarterly.
