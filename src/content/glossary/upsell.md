## Definition
An upsell is selling a higher plan or add-on to an existing customer, contributing to expansion revenue.

## Why it matters
Upsells are a primary driver of net revenue retention. They can offset churn and reduce reliance on new customer growth.

## Pricing implications
Clear tier differentiation and upgrade triggers increase upsell rates. If upsells are low, pricing tiers may not be
aligned with customer value.

## Measurement tips
Track upsell rates by cohort and plan to see where expansion happens.

## Checklist
- Define what counts as an upsell vs cross-sell.
- Track upsells by plan and segment.
- Identify features that trigger upgrades.
- Monitor upsell rates after pricing changes.
- Avoid one-time fees in upsell reporting.
- Use upsell trends to refine tier thresholds.
- Align sales incentives with upsell goals.
- Validate upsell impact on NRR.
