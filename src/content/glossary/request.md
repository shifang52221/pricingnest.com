## Definition
A single operation sent to a service (API request, storage request, etc.).
## Why it matters
API pricing lives or dies on unit economics. A clear unit and cost model prevents margin surprises.
## Common pitfalls
- Treating vendor/API pass-through costs as zero.
- Using p50 usage only (heavy users can break margins).
- Defining units buyers can’t estimate.
