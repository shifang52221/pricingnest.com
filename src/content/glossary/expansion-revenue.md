## Definition
Expansion revenue is additional revenue from existing customers through upsells, usage growth, or add-ons.

## Why it matters
Expansion revenue is a key driver of net revenue retention (NRR). It can offset churn and improve unit economics.

## Pricing implications
Strong expansion revenue can justify lower entry prices, but relying on expansion alone can mask churn problems. Pricing
should encourage natural expansion without surprise bills.

## Measurement tips
Track expansion by cohort and plan to see which segments expand reliably.

## Checklist
- Separate expansion from new revenue and churn.
- Track expansion by plan and segment.
- Identify the features or limits that drive expansion.
- Use expansion trends to refine tier thresholds.
- Avoid counting one-time fees as expansion.
- Monitor expansion after pricing changes.
- Compare expansion to churn to compute NRR.
- Validate expansion with billing data.
