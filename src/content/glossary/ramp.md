## Definition
Ramp is the pace at which customers grow into paid usage after signing up.

## Why it matters
Ramp speed affects payback period and revenue forecasting. Slow ramp extends payback and increases risk.

## Pricing implications
If ramp is slow, use longer trials or lower entry tiers. If ramp is fast, higher base fees may be feasible.

## Measurement tips
Track usage growth by cohort month to estimate ramp curves.

## Checklist
- Measure ramp by cohort and segment.
- Separate trial ramp from paid ramp.
- Use ramp in CAC payback modeling.
- Align tier thresholds with expected ramp.
- Monitor ramp after pricing changes.
- Avoid assuming instant full usage.
- Document ramp assumptions in models.
- Review ramp quarterly.
