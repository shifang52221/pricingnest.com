## Definition
Break-even churn is the churn rate at which a price increase yields the same revenue as before.

## Why it matters
It helps you quantify how much churn you can tolerate when raising prices.

## Pricing implications
If expected churn exceeds break-even, the increase will reduce revenue. Use this to decide on grandfathering or phased
rollouts.

## Measurement tips
Calculate break-even churn by segment because sensitivity differs by plan and contract term.

## Checklist
- Calculate break-even churn before a price increase.
- Compare expected churn to break-even by segment.
- Decide on grandfathering or phased rollout.
- Monitor churn and downgrades after changes.
- Use a pilot cohort when risk is high.
- Track support volume during rollout.
- Revisit break-even assumptions after launch.
- Document learnings for future tests.
