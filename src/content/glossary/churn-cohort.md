## Definition
Churn cohort is churn measured for a specific signup or start-date cohort, rather than the whole customer base.

## Why it matters
Cohort churn shows whether retention is improving or worsening over time. It removes the noise of mixed customer ages.

## Pricing implications
Pricing or packaging changes can improve churn for new cohorts even if the overall churn rate looks flat. Cohort analysis
helps you see those changes earlier.

## Measurement tips
Track churn by cohort month and plan to identify which cohorts benefit from pricing changes.

## Checklist
- Define cohorts by start month or plan.
- Track churn by cohort age (month 1, month 2, month 3).
- Separate logo churn and revenue churn.
- Compare cohorts before and after pricing changes.
- Avoid mixing trial and paid cohorts.
- Use consistent churn definitions across reports.
- Highlight cohorts with unusually high churn.
- Use cohort curves in pricing reviews.
