## Definition
Revenue per seat is the average recurring revenue generated per active seat.

## Why it matters
It connects seat-based pricing to unit economics and helps you compare plans with different seat pricing.

## Pricing implications
If revenue per seat declines as seat count grows, you may need higher enterprise tiers or minimums to protect margin.

## Measurement tips
Use active seats, not licensed seats, to avoid overstating revenue per seat.

## Checklist
- Define what counts as an active seat.
- Use a consistent time window (monthly or quarterly).
- Track revenue per seat by plan and segment.
- Compare revenue per seat before and after pricing changes.
- Separate revenue per seat from ARPA (per account).
- Normalize annual contracts to monthly revenue.
- Avoid mixing usage revenue into seat metrics unless explicit.
- Use the metric to guide tier thresholds.
