## Definition
LTV is the expected gross profit from a customer over their lifetime, based on ARPA, churn, and margin.
## Why it matters
LTV guides acquisition spend, pricing decisions, and product investment by showing long-term profitability.
## Pricing implications
Higher ARPA and higher gross margin increase LTV; high churn can destroy it quickly.
## Measurement tips
Use consistent time windows, segment by plan, and validate with cohort retention data.
## Checklist
- Define ARPA and the time window used.
- Use gross margin, not revenue.
- Use logo churn or revenue churn consistently.
- Segment LTV by plan and channel.
- Model downside scenarios (p90 churn).
- Track LTV changes after pricing updates.
- Align sales comp with LTV targets.
- Document assumptions and formulas.
## Examples
- LTV = ARPA * Gross Margin / Churn.
