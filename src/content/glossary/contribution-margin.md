## Definition
Contribution margin is margin after variable costs, often gross profit minus variable sales, marketing, and support.

## Why it matters
Contribution margin is a better input for CAC payback and LTV than gross margin when variable support or onboarding
costs are significant.

## Pricing implications
If contribution margin is lower than expected, pricing or support costs may need adjustment. Use it to set payback
targets and plan thresholds.

## Measurement tips
Define which variable costs are included and keep it consistent across reports.

## Checklist
- Define variable costs included in contribution margin.
- Separate fixed overhead from variable costs.
- Use contribution margin for payback models.
- Track contribution margin by plan and segment.
- Update cost allocations quarterly.
- Align with finance definitions.
- Avoid mixing gross and contribution margin.
- Validate against actual support and onboarding costs.
