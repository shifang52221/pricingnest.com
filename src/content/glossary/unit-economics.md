## Definition
Unit economics measure profitability per customer or per unit of usage.
## Why it matters
Unit economics determine whether growth is sustainable and guide pricing and acquisition decisions.
## Pricing implications
If unit economics are weak, adjust pricing, reduce costs, or target different segments.
## Measurement tips
Use cohort-based churn and contribution margin for accuracy.
## Checklist
- Define the unit (customer, seat, request).
- Calculate gross and contribution margins.
- Compare LTV to CAC by segment.
- Track payback period trends.
- Update models quarterly.
- Avoid mixing one-time revenue into LTV.
- Use cohort data to validate assumptions.
- Share unit economics with product and finance.
