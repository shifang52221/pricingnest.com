## Definition
Fixed costs are expenses that do not scale with usage, such as baseline infrastructure, tooling, and salaries.
## Why it matters
If fixed costs are ignored, pricing can look profitable at low usage but fail to recover overhead.
## Pricing implications
Use a base fee or platform fee to recover fixed costs. Spread fixed costs across expected volume.
## Measurement tips
Separate fixed costs from variable costs in your model.
## Checklist
- List fixed costs by category.
- Allocate fixed costs per plan or segment.
- Use base fees to recover fixed costs.
- Recalculate fixed costs quarterly.
- Avoid hiding fixed costs in variable pricing.
- Validate fixed costs with finance data.
- Update costs after staffing changes.
- Document fixed cost assumptions.
