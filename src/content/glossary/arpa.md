## Definition
ARPA (average revenue per account) or ARPU (per user) measures run-rate revenue per customer or user over a period.
## Why it matters
ARPA drives LTV, payback, and segmentation decisions, and it reveals whether pricing aligns with value.
## Pricing implications
Use ARPA by segment to set plan boundaries, minimums, and overages that match willingness to pay.
## Measurement tips
Use a consistent time window, exclude one-time fees unless modeled separately, and separate expansion from new revenue.
## Checklist
- Define account vs user clearly.
- Pick a standard time window (monthly or annual).
- Separate new, expansion, and churned revenue.
- Track ARPA by segment and plan.
- Compare ARPA to support and infra costs.
- Monitor ARPA drift after pricing changes.
- Document assumptions in models.
- Reconcile ARPA with billing data.
