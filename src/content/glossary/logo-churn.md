## Definition
Logo churn is the percentage of customers who cancel during a period, regardless of revenue impact.

## Why it matters
Logo churn highlights customer retention quality. It can move differently than revenue churn if small accounts churn
faster than large accounts.

## Pricing implications
High logo churn may signal mispricing for smaller customers or a weak onboarding experience. Adjust entry pricing,
free-tier limits, or activation flows to reduce early churn.

## Measurement tips
Track logo churn by cohort, plan, and acquisition channel to identify where churn is concentrated.

## Checklist
- Use a consistent time window (monthly or quarterly).
- Separate logo churn from revenue churn.
- Track logo churn by plan and segment.
- Monitor early-life churn vs long-term churn.
- Tie churn changes to pricing or packaging updates.
- Avoid mixing trials with paid customers.
- Investigate churn reasons with exit surveys.
- Use logo churn as a leading indicator for revenue churn.
